The Rust Programming Language
There are two editions of “The Rust Programming Language”:
First edition
Second edition
The second edition is a complete re-write. It is still under construction;
though it is far enough along to learn most of Rust; we suggest reading the
second edition and then checking out the first edition later to pick up some of
the more esoteric parts of the language.
