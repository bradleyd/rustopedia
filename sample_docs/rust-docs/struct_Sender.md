Expand description
The sending-half of Rustโs asynchronous
channel
type.
Messages can be sent through this channel with
send
.
Note: all senders (the original and its clones) need to be dropped for the receiver
to stop blocking to receive messages with
Receiver::recv
.
ยง
Examples
use
std::sync::mpsc::channel;
use
std::thread;
let
(sender, receiver) = channel();
let
sender2 = sender.clone();
// First thread owns sender
thread::spawn(
move
|| {
    sender.send(
1
).unwrap();
});
// Second thread owns sender2
thread::spawn(
move
|| {
    sender2.send(
2
).unwrap();
});
let
msg = receiver.recv().unwrap();
let
msg2 = receiver.recv().unwrap();
assert_eq!
(
3
, msg + msg2);

pub fn
send
(&self, t: T) ->
Result
<

,
SendError
<T>>
Attempts to send a value on this channel, returning it back if it could
not be sent.
A successful send occurs when it is determined that the other end of
the channel has not hung up already. An unsuccessful send would be one
where the corresponding receiver has already been deallocated. Note
that a return value of
Err
means that the data will never be
received, but a return value of
Ok
does
not
mean that the data
will be received. It is possible for the corresponding receiver to
hang up immediately after this function returns
Ok
.
This method will never block the current thread.

Examples
use
std::sync::mpsc::channel;
let
(tx, rx) = channel();
// This send is always successful
tx.send(
1
).unwrap();
// This send will fail because the receiver is gone
drop(rx);

1
).unwrap_err().

fn
clone
(&self) ->

Clone a sender to send to other threads.
Note, be aware of the lifetime of the sender because all senders
(including the original) need to be dropped in order for
Receiver::recv
to stop blocking.
