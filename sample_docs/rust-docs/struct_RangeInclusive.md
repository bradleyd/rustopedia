This is a nightly-only experimental API. (

#125687
)
Expand description
A range bounded inclusively below and above (
start..=end
).
The
RangeInclusive
start..=end
contains all values with
x >= start
and
x <= end
. It is empty unless
start <= end
.
This iterator is
fused
, but the specific values of
start
and
end
after
iteration has finished are
unspecified
other than that
.is_empty()
will return
true
once no more values will be produced.
§
Examples
The
start..=end
syntax is a
RangeInclusive
:
assert_eq!
((
3
..=
5
), std::ops::RangeInclusive::new(
3
,
5
));
assert_eq!
(
3
+
4
+
5
, (
3
..=
5
).sum());
let
arr = [
0
,
1
,
2
,
3
,

];
assert_eq!
(arr[ ..  ], [
0

Creates a new inclusive range. Equivalent to writing

pub const fn
start
(&self) ->
&Idx
Returns the lower bound of the range (inclusive).
When using an inclusive range for iteration, the values of
start()
and
end()
are unspecified after the iteration ended. To determine
whether the inclusive range is empty, use the
is_empty()
method
instead of comparing
start() > end()
.
Note: the value returned by this method is unspecified after the range
has been iterated to exhaustion.
