pub struct DirEntry(
/* private fields */
);
Expand description
Entries returned by the
ReadDir
iterator.
An instance of
DirEntry
represents an entry inside of a directory on the
filesystem. Each entry can be inspected via methods to learn about the full
path or possibly other metadata through per-platform extension traits.
ยง
Platform-specific behavior
On Unix, the
DirEntry
struct contains an internal reference to the open
directory. Holding
DirEntry
objects will consume a file handle even
after the
ReadDir
iterator is dropped.
Note that this
may change in the future
.

impl
DirEntry
1.0.0
ยท
Source
pub fn
path
(&self) ->
PathBuf
Returns the full path to the file that this entry represents.
The full path is created by joining the original path to
read_dir
with the filename of this entry.
ยง
Examples
use
std::fs;
fn
main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
for
entry
in
fs::read_dir(
"."
)
?
{
let
dir = entry
?
;
println!
(
"{:?}"
, dir.path());
    }
Ok
(())
}
This prints output like:
"./whatever.txt"
"./foo.html"
"./hello_world.rs"
The exact text, of course, depends on what files you have in
.
.

Source
pub fn
metadata
(&self) ->
Result
<
Metadata
>
Returns the metadata for the file that this entry points at.
This function will not traverse symlinks if this entry points at a
symlink. To traverse symlinks use
fs::metadata
or
fs::File::metadata
.
ยง
Platform-specific behavior
On Windows this function is cheap to call (no extra system calls
needed), but on Unix platforms this function is the equivalent of
calling
symlink_metadata
on the path.
ยง
Examples
use
std::fs;
if let
Ok
(entries) = fs::read_dir(
"."
) {
for
entry
in
entries {
if let
Ok
(entry) = entry {
// Here, `entry` is a `DirEntry`.
if let
Ok
(metadata) = entry.metadata() {
// Now let's show our entry's permissions!
println!
(
"{:?}: {:?}"
, entry.path(), metadata.permissions());
            }
else
{
println!
(
"Couldn't get metadata for {:?}"
, entry.path());
            }
        }
    }
}

Source
pub fn
file_type
(&self) ->
Result
<
FileType
>
Returns the file type for the file that this entry points at.
This function will not traverse symlinks if this entry points at a
symlink.
ยง
Platform-specific behavior
On Windows and most Unix platforms this function is free (no extra
system calls needed), but some Unix platforms may require the equivalent
call to
symlink_metadata
to learn about the target file type.
ยง
Examples
use
std::fs;
if let
Ok
(entries) = fs::read_dir(
"."
) {
for
entry
in
entries {
if let
Ok
(entry) = entry {
// Here, `entry` is a `DirEntry`.
if let
Ok
(file_type) = entry.file_type() {
// Now let's show our entry's file type!
println!
(
"{:?}: {:?}"
, entry.path(), file_type);
            }
else
{
println!
(
"Couldn't get file type for {:?}"
, entry.path());
            }
        }
    }
}

Source
pub fn
file_name
(&self) ->
OsString
Returns the file name of this directory entry without any
leading path component(s).
As an example,
the output of the function will result in โfooโ for all the following paths:
โ./fooโ
โ/the/fooโ
โ../../fooโ
ยง
Examples
use
std::fs;
if let
Ok
(entries) = fs::read_dir(
"."
) {
for
entry
in
entries {
if let
Ok
(entry) = entry {
// Here, `entry` is a `DirEntry`.
println!
(
"{:?}"
, entry.file_name());
        }
    }
}
