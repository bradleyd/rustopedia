pub enum Poll<T> {
    Ready(T),
    Pending,

Expand description
Indicates whether a value is available or if the current task has been
scheduled to receive a wakeup instead.
This is returned by
Future::poll
.
Variants
Â§
Â§
1.36.0
Ready(T)
Represents that a value is immediately ready.
Â§
1.36.0
Pending
Represents that a value is not ready yet.
When a function returns
Pending
, the function
must
also
ensure that the current task is scheduled to be awoken when
progress can be made.

Â·
Source
pub fn
map
<U, F>(self, f: F) ->
Poll
<U>
where
    F:
FnOnce
(T) -> U,
Maps a
Poll<T>
to
Poll<U>
by applying a function to a contained value.
Â§
Examples
Converts a
Poll<
String
>
into a
Poll<
usize
>
, consuming
the original:
let
poll_some_string = Poll::Ready(String::from(
"Hello, World!"
));
// `Poll::map` takes self *by value*, consuming `poll_some_string`
let
poll_some_len = poll_some_string.map(|s| s.len());
assert_eq!
(poll_some_len, Poll::Ready(
13
));

Source
pub const fn
is_ready
(&self) ->
bool
Returns
true
if the poll is a
Poll::Ready
value.
Â§
Examples
let
x: Poll<u32> = Poll::Ready(
2
);
assert_eq!
(x.is_ready(),
true
);
let
x: Poll<u32> = Poll::Pending;

pub const fn
is_pending
(&self) ->

Pending
value.

Source
pub fn
map_ok
<U, F>(self, f: F) ->
Poll
<
Result
<U, E>>
where
    F:
FnOnce
(T) -> U,
Maps a
Poll<Result<T, E>>
to
Poll<Result<U, E>>
by applying a
function to a contained
Poll::Ready(Ok)
value, leaving all other
variants untouched.
This function can be used to compose the results of two functions.
Â§
Examples
let
res: Poll<
Result
<u8,
_
>> = Poll::Ready(
"12"
.parse());
let
squared = res.map_ok(|n| n * n);

where

Maps a
Poll::Ready<Result<T, E>>
to
Poll::Ready<Result<T, F>>
by
applying a function to a contained
Poll::Ready(Err)
value, leaving all other
variants untouched.
This function can be used to pass through a successful result while handling
an error.
Â§
Examples
let
res: Poll<
Result
<u8,
_
