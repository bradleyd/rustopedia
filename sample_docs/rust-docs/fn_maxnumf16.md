This is a nightly-only experimental API. (

)
Expand description
Returns the maximum of two
f16
values.
Note that, unlike most intrinsics, this is safe to call;
it does not require an
unsafe
block.
Therefore, implementations must not require the user to uphold
any safety invariants.
The stabilized version of this intrinsic is
f16::max
