Atomic memory orderings
Memory orderings specify the way atomic operations synchronize memory.
In its weakest
Ordering::Relaxed
, only the memory directly touched by the
operation is synchronized. On the other hand, a store-load pair of
Ordering::SeqCst
operations synchronize other memory while additionally preserving a total order of such
operations across all threads.
Rustโs memory orderings are
the same as those of
C++20
.
For more information see the
nomicon
.
Variants (Non-exhaustive)
ยง
This enum is marked as non-exhaustive
Non-exhaustive enums could have additional variants added in future. Therefore, when matching against variants of non-exhaustive enums, an extra wildcard arm must be added to account for any future variants.
ยง
1.0.0
Relaxed
No ordering constraints, only atomic operations.
Corresponds to
memory_order_relaxed
in C++20.
ยง
1.0.0
Release
When coupled with a store, all previous operations become ordered
before any load of this value with
Acquire
(or stronger) ordering.
In particular, all previous writes become visible to all threads
that perform an
Acquire
(or stronger) load of this value.
Notice that using this ordering for an operation that combines loads
and stores leads to a
Relaxed
load operation!
This ordering is only applicable for operations that can perform a store.
Corresponds to
memory_order_release
in C++20.
ยง
1.0.0
Acquire
When coupled with a load, if the loaded value was written by a store operation with
Release
(or stronger) ordering, then all subsequent operations
become ordered after that store. In particular, all subsequent loads will see data
written before the store.
Notice that using this ordering for an operation that combines loads
and stores leads to a
Relaxed
store operation!
This ordering is only applicable for operations that can perform a load.
Corresponds to
memory_order_acquire
in C++20.
ยง
1.0.0
AcqRel
Has the effects of both
Acquire
and
Release
together:
For loads it uses
Acquire
ordering. For stores it uses the
Release
ordering.
Notice that in the case of
compare_and_swap
, it is possible that the operation ends up
not performing any store and hence it has just
Acquire
ordering. However,
AcqRel
will never perform
Relaxed
accesses.
This ordering is only applicable for operations that combine both loads and stores.
Corresponds to
memory_order_acq_rel
in C++20.
ยง
1.0.0
SeqCst
Like
Acquire
/
Release
/
AcqRel
(for load, store, and load-with-store
operations, respectively) with the additional guarantee that all threads see all
sequentially consistent operations in the same order.
Corresponds to
memory_order_seq_cst
in C++20.
