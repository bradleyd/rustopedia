tuple - Rust

Expand description
A finite heterogeneous sequence,
(T, U, ..)
.
Let’s cover each of those in turn:
Tuples are
finite
. In other words, a tuple has a length. Here’s a tuple
of length
3
:
(
"hello"
,
5
,
'c'
);
‘Length’ is also sometimes called ‘arity’ here; each tuple of a different
length is a different, distinct type.
Tuples are
heterogeneous
. This means that each element of the tuple can
have a different type. In that tuple above, it has the type:
(
&
'static
str, i32, char)
Tuples are a
sequence
. This means that they can be accessed by position;
this is called ‘tuple indexing’, and it looks like this:
let
tuple = (
"hello"
,
5
,
'c'
);
assert_eq!
(tuple.
0
,
"hello"
);
assert_eq!
(tuple.
1
,
5
);
assert_eq!
(tuple.
2
,
'c'
);
The sequential nature of the tuple applies to its implementations of various
traits. For example, in
PartialOrd
and
Ord
, the elements are compared
sequentially until the first non-equal set is found.
For more about tuples, see
the book
.
§
Trait implementations
In this documentation the shorthand
(T₁, T₂, …, Tₙ)
is used to represent tuples of varying
length. When that is used, any trait bound expressed on
T
applies to each element of the
tuple independently. Note that this is a convenience notation to avoid repetitive
documentation, not valid Rust syntax.
Due to a temporary restriction in Rust’s type system, the following traits are only
implemented on tuples of arity 12 or less. In the future, this may change:
PartialEq
Eq
PartialOrd
Ord
Debug
Default
Hash
From<[T; N]>
The following traits are implemented for tuples of any length. These traits have
implementations that are automatically generated by the compiler, so are not limited by
missing language features.
Clone
Copy
Send
Sync
Unpin
UnwindSafe
RefUnwindSafe
§
Examples
Basic usage:
let
tuple = (
"hello"
,
5
,
'c'
);
assert_eq!
(tuple.
0
,
"hello"
);
Tuples are often used as a return type when you want to return more than
one value:
fn
calculate_point() -> (i32, i32) {
// Don't do a calculation, that's not the point of the example
(
4
,
5
)
}
let
point = calculate_point();
assert_eq!
(point.
0
,
4
);
assert_eq!
(point.
1
,
5
);
// Combining this with patterns can be nicer.
let
(x, y) = calculate_point();
assert_eq!
(x,
4
);
assert_eq!
(y,
5
);
Homogeneous tuples can be created from arrays of appropriate length:
let
array: [u32;
3
] = [
1
,
2
,
3
];
let
tuple: (u32, u32, u32) = array.into();
