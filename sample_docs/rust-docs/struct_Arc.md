Expand description
A thread-safe reference-counting pointer. ‚ÄòArc‚Äô stands for ‚ÄòAtomically
Reference Counted‚Äô.
The type
Arc<T>
provides shared ownership of a value of type
T
,
allocated in the heap. Invoking
clone
on
Arc
produces
a new
Arc
instance, which points to the same allocation on the heap as the
source
Arc
, while increasing a reference count. When the last
Arc
pointer to a given allocation is destroyed, the value stored in that allocation (often
referred to as ‚Äúinner value‚Äù) is also dropped.
Shared references in Rust disallow mutation by default, and
Arc
is no
exception: you cannot generally obtain a mutable reference to something
inside an
Arc
. If you do need to mutate through an
Arc
, you have several options:
Use interior mutability with synchronization primitives like
Mutex
,
RwLock
, or one of the
Atomic
types.
Use clone-on-write semantics with
Arc::make_mut
which provides efficient mutation
without requiring interior mutability. This approach clones the data only when
needed (when there are multiple references) and can be more efficient when mutations
are infrequent.
Use
Arc::get_mut
when you know your
Arc
is not shared (has a reference count of 1),
which provides direct mutable access to the inner value without any cloning.
use
std::sync::Arc;
let
mut
data = Arc::new(
vec!
[
1
,
2
,
3
]);
// This will clone the vector only if there are other references to it
Arc::make_mut(
&mut
data).push(
4
);
assert_eq!
(
*
data,
vec!
[
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
]);
Note
: This type is only available on platforms that support atomic
loads and stores of pointers, which includes all platforms that support
the
std
crate but not all those which only support
alloc
.
This may be detected at compile time using
#[cfg(target_has_atomic = "ptr")]
.
¬ß
Thread Safety
Unlike
Rc<T>
,
Arc<T>
uses atomic operations for its reference
counting. This means that it is thread-safe. The disadvantage is that
atomic operations are more expensive than ordinary memory accesses. If you
are not sharing reference-counted allocations between threads, consider using
Rc<T>
for lower overhead.
Rc<T>
is a safe default, because the
compiler will catch any attempt to send an
Rc<T>
between threads.
However, a library might choose
Arc<T>
in order to give library consumers
more flexibility.
Arc<T>
will implement
Send
and
Sync
as long as the
T
implements
Send
and
Sync
. Why can‚Äôt you put a non-thread-safe type
T
in an
Arc<T>
to make it thread-safe? This may be a bit counter-intuitive at
first: after all, isn‚Äôt the point of
Arc<T>
thread safety? The key is
this:
Arc<T>
makes it thread safe to have multiple ownership of the same
data, but it  doesn‚Äôt add thread safety to its data. Consider
Arc<
RefCell<T>
>
.
RefCell<T>
isn‚Äôt
Sync
, and if
Arc<T>
was always
Send
,
Arc<
RefCell<T>
>
would be as well. But then we‚Äôd have a problem:
RefCell<T>
is not thread safe; it keeps track of the borrowing count using
non-atomic operations.
In the end, this means that you may need to pair
Arc<T>
with some sort of
std::sync
type, usually
Mutex<T>
.
¬ß
Breaking cycles with
Weak
The
downgrade
method can be used to create a non-owning
Weak
pointer. A
Weak
pointer can be
upgrade
d
to an
Arc
, but this will return
None
if the value stored in the allocation has
already been dropped. In other words,
Weak
pointers do not keep the value
inside the allocation alive; however, they
do
keep the allocation
(the backing store for the value) alive.
A cycle between
Arc
pointers will never be deallocated. For this reason,
Weak
is used to break cycles. For example, a tree could have
strong
Arc
pointers from parent nodes to children, and
Weak
pointers from children back to their parents.
¬ß
Cloning references
Creating a new reference from an existing reference-counted pointer is done using the
Clone
trait implemented for
Arc<T>
and
Weak<T>
.
use
std::sync::Arc;
let
foo = Arc::new(
vec!
[
1.0
,
2.0
,
3.0
]);
// The two syntaxes below are equivalent.
let
a = foo.clone();
let
b = Arc::clone(
&
foo);
// a, b, and foo are all Arcs that point to the same memory location
¬ß
Deref
behavior
Arc<T>
automatically dereferences to
T
(via the
Deref
trait),
so you can call
T
‚Äôs methods on a value of type
Arc<T>
. To avoid name
clashes with
T
‚Äôs methods, the methods of
Arc<T>
itself are associated
functions, called using
fully qualified syntax
:
use
std::sync::Arc;
let
my_arc = Arc::new(());
let
my_weak = Arc::downgrade(
&
my_arc);
Arc<T>
‚Äôs implementations of traits like
Clone
may also be called using
fully qualified syntax. Some people prefer to use fully qualified syntax,
while others prefer using method-call syntax.
use
std::sync::Arc;
let
arc = Arc::new(());
// Method-call syntax
let
arc2 = arc.clone();
// Fully qualified syntax
let
arc3 = Arc::clone(
&
arc);
Weak<T>
does not auto-dereference to
T
, because the inner value may have
already been dropped.
¬ß
Examples
Sharing some immutable data between threads:
use
std::sync::Arc;
use
std::thread;
let
five = Arc::new(
5
);
for _ in
0
..
10
{
let
five = Arc::clone(
&
five);

    thread::spawn(
move
|| {
println!
(
"{five:?}"
);
    });
}
Sharing a mutable
AtomicUsize
:
use
std::sync::Arc;
use
std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};
use
std::thread;
let
val = Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(
5
));
for _ in
0
..
10
{
let
val = Arc::clone(
&
val);

    thread::spawn(
move
|| {
let
v = val.fetch_add(
1
, Ordering::Relaxed);
println!
(
"{v:?}"
);
    });
}

<F>(data_fn: F) ->

FnOnce
(&
Weak
<T>) -> T,
Constructs a new
Arc<T>
while giving you a
Weak<T>
to the allocation,
to allow you to construct a
T
which holds a weak pointer to itself.
Generally, a structure circularly referencing itself, either directly or
indirectly, should not hold a strong reference to itself to prevent a memory leak.
Using this function, you get access to the weak pointer during the
initialization of
T
, before the
Arc<T>
is created, such that you can
clone and store it inside the
T
.
new_cyclic
first allocates the managed allocation for the
Arc<T>
,
then calls your closure, giving it a
Weak<T>
to this allocation,
and only afterwards completes the construction of the
Arc<T>
by placing
the
T
returned from your closure into the allocation.
Since the new
Arc<T>
is not fully-constructed until
Arc<T>::new_cyclic
returns, calling
upgrade
on the weak reference inside your closure will
fail and result in a
None
value.

Returns the inner value, if the

Otherwise, an
Err
is returned with the same
Arc
that was
passed in.
This will succeed even if there are outstanding weak references.
It is strongly recommended to use
Arc::into_inner
instead if you don‚Äôt
keep the
Arc
in the
Err
case.
Immediately dropping the
Err
-value, as the expression
Arc::try_unwrap(this).ok()
does, can cause the strong count to
drop to zero and the inner value of the
Arc
to be dropped.
For instance, if two threads execute such an expression in parallel,
there is a race condition without the possibility of unsafety:
The threads could first both check whether they own the last instance
in
Arc::try_unwrap
, determine that they both do not, and then both
discard and drop their instance in the call to
ok
.
In this scenario, the value inside the
Arc
is safely destroyed
by exactly one of the threads, but neither thread will ever be able
to use the value.

If

Minimal example demonstrating the guarantee that
Arc::into_inner
gives.

let

// Two threads calling `Arc::into_inner` on both clones of an `Arc`:

Some
(
3
),
None
)
));
// The result could also be `(None, None)` if the threads called
// `Arc::try_unwrap(x).ok()` and `Arc::try_unwrap(y).ok()` instead.
A more practical example demonstrating the need for
Arc::into_inner
:
use
std::sync::Arc;
// Definition of a simple singly linked list using `Arc`:
#[derive(Clone)]
struct
LinkedList<T>(
Option
<Arc<Node<T>>>);
struct
Node<T>(T,
Option

// Dropping a long `LinkedList<T>` relying on the destructor of `Arc`
// can cause a stack overflow. To prevent this, we can provide a
// manual `Drop` implementation that does the destruction in a loop:
impl
<T> Drop
for
LinkedList<T> {
fn
drop(
&mut
self
) {
let
mut
link =
self
.
0
.take();
while let
Some
(arc_node) = link.take() {
if let
Some
(Node(_value, next)) = Arc::into_inner(arc_node) {
                link = next;

        }
    }
}
// Implementation of `new` and `push` omitted
impl
<T> LinkedList<T> {
/* ... */
}
// The following code could have still caused a stack overflow
// despite the manual `Drop` impl if that `Drop` impl had used
// `Arc::try_unwrap(arc).ok()` instead of `Arc::into_inner(arc)`.

// Create a long list and clone it
let
mut
x = LinkedList::new();
let
size =
100000
;
for
i
in
0
..size {
    x.push(i);
// Adds i to the front of x
}
let
y = x.clone();
// Drop the clones in parallel
let

The raw pointer must point to a block of memory allocated by the global allocator.
The user of

This function is unsafe because improper use may lead to memory unsafety,

Returns a mutable reference into the given
Arc
, if there are
no other
Arc

Weak
pointers to the same allocation.
Returns
None
otherwise, because it is not safe to
mutate a shared value.
See also

clone
the inner value when there are other
Arc

This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
get_mut_unchecked
#63292
)
Returns a mutable reference into the given
Arc
,
without any check.
See also
get_mut
, which is safe and does appropriate checks.
¬ß
Safety
If any other
Arc
or
Weak
pointers to the same allocation exist, then
they must not be dereferenced or have active borrows for the duration
of the returned borrow, and their inner type must be exactly the same as the
inner type of this Rc (including lifetimes). This is trivially the case if no
such pointers exist, for example immediately after
Arc::new
.
¬ß
Examples
#![feature(get_mut_unchecked)]

mut
x = Arc::new(String::new());

{
    Arc::get_mut_unchecked(
&mut
x).push_str(
"foo"
)
}
assert_eq!
(
*
x,
"foo"
);
Other
Arc
pointers to the same allocation must be to the same type.
#![feature(get_mut_unchecked)]
use
std::sync::Arc;
let
x: Arc<str> = Arc::from(
"Hello, world!"
);
let
mut
y: Arc<[u8]> = x.clone().into();
unsafe
{
// this is Undefined Behavior, because x's inner type is str, not [u8]
Arc::get_mut_unchecked(
&mut
y).fill(
0xff
);
// 0xff is invalid in UTF-8
}
println!
(
"{}"

// Invalid UTF-8 in a str
Other

The conversion moves the value into a
newly allocated
Arc
. It is equivalent to
calling
Arc::new(t)
.

Performance characteristics
¬ß
The general case
In the general case, collecting into
Arc<[T]>
is done by first
collecting into a
Vec<T>
. That is, when writing the following:
let
evens: Arc<[u8]> = (
0
..
10
).filter(|
&
x| x %
2
==
0
).collect();
this behaves as if we wrote:
let
evens: Arc<[u8]> = (
0
..
10
).filter(|
&
x| x %
2
==
0
)
    .collect::<Vec<
_
>>()
// The first set of allocations happens here.
.into();
// A second allocation for `Arc<[T]>` happens here.
This will allocate as many times as needed for constructing the
Vec<T>
and then it will allocate once for turning the
Vec<T>
into the
Arc<[T]>
.
¬ß
Iterators of known length
When your
Iterator
implements
TrustedLen
and is of an exact size,
a single allocation will be made for the
Arc<[T]>
. For example:
let
evens: Arc<[u8]> = (
0
..
10
).collect();
// Just a single allocation happens here.
