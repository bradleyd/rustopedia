Expand description
A
BufRead
is a type of
Read
er which has an internal buffer, allowing it
to perform extra ways of reading.
For example, reading line-by-line is inefficient without using a buffer, so
if you want to read by line, youâ€™ll need
BufRead
, which includes a
read_line
method as well as a
lines
iterator.
Â§
Examples
A locked standard input implements
BufRead
:
use
std::io;
use
std::io::prelude::
*
;
let
stdin = io::stdin();
for
line
in
stdin.lock().lines() {
println!
(
"{}"
, line
?
);
}
If you have something that implements
Read
, you can use the
BufReader
type
to turn it into a
BufRead
.
For example,
File
implements
Read
, but not
BufRead
.
BufReader
to the rescue!
use
std::io::{
self
, BufReader};
use
std::io::prelude::
*
;
use
std::fs::File;
fn
main() -> io::Result<()> {
let
f = File::open(
"foo.txt"
)
?
;
let
f = BufReader::new(f);
for
line
in
f.lines() {
let
line = line
?
;
println!
(
"{line}"
);
    }
Ok
(())
}
Required Methods
Â§
1.0.0
Â·
Source
fn
fill_buf
(&mut self) ->
Result
<&[
u8
]>
Returns the contents of the internal buffer, filling it with more data, via
Read
methods, if empty.
This is a lower-level method and is meant to be used together with
consume
,
which can be used to mark bytes that should not be returned by subsequent calls to
read
.
Returns an empty buffer when the stream has reached EOF.
Â§
Errors
This function will return an I/O error if a
Read
method was called, but returned an error.
Â§
Examples
A locked standard input implements
BufRead
:
use
std::io;
use
std::io::prelude::
*
;
let
stdin = io::stdin();
let
mut
stdin = stdin.lock();
let
buffer = stdin.fill_buf()
?
;
// work with buffer
println!
(
"{buffer:?}"
);
// mark the bytes we worked with as read
let
length = buffer.len();
stdin.consume(length);

fn
consume
(&mut self, amount:
usize
)
Marks the given
amount
of additional bytes from the internal buffer as having been read.
Subsequent calls to
read
only return bytes that have not been marked as read.
This is a lower-level method and is meant to be used together with
fill_buf
,
which can be used to fill the internal buffer via
Read
methods.
It is a logic error if
amount
exceeds the number of unread bytes in the internal buffer, which is returned by
fill_buf
.
Â§
Examples
Since
consume()
is meant to be used with
fill_buf
,
that methodâ€™s example includes an example of
consume()
.
Provided Methods
Â§
Source
fn
has_data_left
(&mut self) ->
Result
<
bool
>
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
buf_read_has_data_left
#86423
)
Checks if there is any data left to be
read
.
This function may fill the buffer to check for data,
so this functions returns
Result<bool>
, not
bool
.
Default implementation calls
fill_buf
and checks that
returned slice is empty (which means that there is no data left,
since EOF is reached).
Â§
Errors
This function will return an I/O error if a
Read
method was called, but returned an error.
Examples
#![feature(buf_read_has_data_left)]
use
std::io;
use
std::io::prelude::
*
;
let
stdin = io::stdin();
let
mut
stdin = stdin.lock();
while
stdin.has_data_left()
?
{
let
mut
line = String::new();
    stdin.read_line(
&mut
line)
?
;
// work with line
println!
(
"{line:?}"
);

fn
read_until
(&mut self, byte:
u8
, buf: &mut
Vec
<
u8
>) ->
Result
<
usize
>
Reads all bytes into
buf
until the delimiter
byte
or EOF is reached.
This function will read bytes from the underlying stream until the
delimiter or EOF is found. Once found, all bytes up to, and including,
the delimiter (if found) will be appended to
buf
.
If successful, this function will return the total number of bytes read.
This function is blocking and should be used carefully: it is possible for
an attacker to continuously send bytes without ever sending the delimiter
or EOF.
Â§
Errors
This function will ignore all instances of
ErrorKind::Interrupted
and
will otherwise return any errors returned by
fill_buf
.
If an I/O error is encountered then all bytes read so far will be
present in
buf
and its length will have been adjusted appropriately.
Â§
Examples
std::io::Cursor
is a type that implements
BufRead
. In
this example, we use
Cursor
to read all the bytes in a byte slice
in hyphen delimited segments:
use
std::io::{
self
, BufRead};
let
mut
cursor = io::Cursor::new(
b"lorem-ipsum"
);
let
mut
buf =
vec!
[];
// cursor is at 'l'
let
num_bytes = cursor.read_until(
b'-'
,
&mut
buf)
    .expect(
"reading from cursor won't fail"
);
assert_eq!
(num_bytes,
6
);
assert_eq!
(buf,
b"lorem-"
);
buf.clear();
// cursor is at 'i'
let
num_bytes = cursor.read_until(
b'-'
,
&mut
buf)
    .expect(
"reading from cursor won't fail"
);
assert_eq!
(num_bytes,
5
);
assert_eq!
(buf,
b"ipsum"
);
buf.clear();
// cursor is at EOF
let
num_bytes = cursor.read_until(
b'-'
,
&mut
buf)
    .expect(
"reading from cursor won't fail"
);
assert_eq!
(num_bytes,
0
);
assert_eq!
(buf,
b""
);

fn
skip_until
(&mut self, byte:
u8
) ->
Result
<
usize
>
Skips all bytes until the delimiter
byte
or EOF is reached.
This function will read (and discard) bytes from the underlying stream until the
delimiter or EOF is found.
If successful, this function will return the total number of bytes read,
including the delimiter byte.
This is useful for efficiently skipping data such as NUL-terminated strings
in binary file formats without buffering.
This function is blocking and should be used carefully: it is possible for
an attacker to continuously send bytes without ever sending the delimiter
or EOF.
Â§
Errors
This function will ignore all instances of
ErrorKind::Interrupted
and
will otherwise return any errors returned by
fill_buf
.
If an I/O error is encountered then all bytes read so far will be
present in
buf
and its length will have been adjusted appropriately.
Â§
Examples
std::io::Cursor
is a type that implements
BufRead
. In
this example, we use
Cursor
to read some NUL-terminated information
about Ferris from a binary string, skipping the fun fact:
use
std::io::{
self
, BufRead};
let
mut
cursor = io::Cursor::new(
b"Ferris\0Likes long walks on the beach\0Crustacean\0"
);
// read name
let
mut
name = Vec::new();
let
num_bytes = cursor.read_until(
b'\0'
,
&mut
name)
    .expect(
"reading from cursor won't fail"
);
assert_eq!
(num_bytes,
7
);
assert_eq!
(name,
b"Ferris\0"
);
// skip fun fact
let
num_bytes = cursor.skip_until(
b'\0'
)
    .expect(
"reading from cursor won't fail"
);
assert_eq!
(num_bytes,
30
);
// read animal type
let
mut
animal = Vec::new();
let
num_bytes = cursor.read_until(
b'\0'
,
&mut
animal)
    .expect(
"reading from cursor won't fail"
);
assert_eq!
(num_bytes,
11
);
assert_eq!
(animal,
b"Crustacean\0"
);

fn
read_line
(&mut self, buf: &mut
String
) ->
Result
<
usize
>
Reads all bytes until a newline (the
0xA
byte) is reached, and append
them to the provided
String
buffer.
Previous content of the buffer will be preserved. To avoid appending to
the buffer, you need to
clear
it first.
This function will read bytes from the underlying stream until the
newline delimiter (the
0xA
byte) or EOF is found. Once found, all bytes
up to, and including, the delimiter (if found) will be appended to
buf
.
If successful, this function will return the total number of bytes read.
If this function returns
Ok(0)
, the stream has reached EOF.
This function is blocking and should be used carefully: it is possible for
an attacker to continuously send bytes without ever sending a newline
or EOF. You can use
take
to limit the maximum number of bytes read.
Â§
Errors
This function has the same error semantics as
read_until
and will
also return an error if the read bytes are not valid UTF-8. If an I/O
error is encountered then
buf
may contain some bytes already read in
the event that all data read so far was valid UTF-8.
Â§
Examples
std::io::Cursor
is a type that implements
BufRead
. In
this example, we use
Cursor
to read all the lines in a byte slice:
use
std::io::{

cursor = io::Cursor::new(
b"foo\nbar"
);
let
mut
buf = String::new();
// cursor is at 'f'
let
num_bytes = cursor.read_line(
&mut
buf)
    .expect(
"reading from cursor won't fail"
);
assert_eq!
(num_bytes,
4
);
assert_eq!
(buf,
"foo\n"
);
buf.clear();
// cursor is at 'b'
let
num_bytes = cursor.read_line(
&mut
buf)
    .expect(
"reading from cursor won't fail"
);
assert_eq!
(num_bytes,
3
);
assert_eq!
(buf,
"bar"
);
buf.clear();
// cursor is at EOF
let
num_bytes = cursor.read_line(
&mut
buf)
    .expect(
"reading from cursor won't fail"
);
assert_eq!
(num_bytes,
0
);
assert_eq!

fn

) ->
Split
<Self>
â“˜
where
    Self:

Returns an iterator over the contents of this reader split on the byte
byte
.
The iterator returned from this function will return instances of
io::Result

This function will yield errors whenever
read_until

also yielded an error.
