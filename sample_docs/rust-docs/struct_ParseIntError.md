pub struct ParseIntError {
/* private fields */
}
Expand description
An error which can be returned when parsing an integer.
This error is used as the error type for the
from_str_radix()
functions
on the primitive integer types, such as
i8::from_str_radix
.
§
Potential causes
Among other causes,
ParseIntError
can be thrown because of leading or trailing whitespace
in the string e.g., when it is obtained from the standard input.
Using the
str::trim()
method ensures that no whitespace remains before parsing.
§
Example
if let
Err
(e) = i32::from_str_radix(
"a12"
,
10
) {
println!
(
"Failed conversion to i32: {e}"
);
}
