This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
new_range_api
#125687
)
Expand description
An unbounded range (
..
).
RangeFull
is primarily used as a
slicing index
, its shorthand is
..
.
It cannot serve as an
Iterator
because it doesnโt have a starting point.
ยง
Examples
The
..
syntax is a
RangeFull
:
assert_eq!
(.., std::ops::RangeFull);
It does not have an
IntoIterator
implementation, so you canโt use it in
a
for
loop directly. This wonโt compile:
โ
for
i
in
.. {
// ...
}
Used as a
slicing index
,
RangeFull
produces the full array as a slice.
let
arr = [
0
,
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
];
assert_eq!
(arr[ ..  ], [
0
,
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
]);
// This is the `RangeFull`
assert_eq!
(arr[ ..
3
], [
0
,
1
,
2
]);
assert_eq!
(arr[ ..=
3
], [
0
,
1
,
2
,
3
]);
assert_eq!
(arr[
1
..  ], [
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
]);
assert_eq!
(arr[
1
..
3
], [
1
,
2
]);
assert_eq!
(arr[
1
..=
3
], [
1
,
2
,

]);

impl
SliceIndex
<
str

RangeFull
Implements substring slicing with syntax
&self[..]
or
&mut self[..]
.
Returns a slice of the whole string, i.e., returns
&self
or
&mut self
. Equivalent to
&self[0 .. len]
or
&mut self[0 .. len]
. Unlike
other indexing operations, this can never panic.
This operation is
O
(1).
Prior to 1.20.0, these indexing operations were still supported by
direct implementation of
Index
and
IndexMut
.
Equivalent to
&self[0 .. len]
or
&mut self[0 .. len]
.
