Expand description
One of the 128 Unicode characters from U+0000 through U+007F,
often known as the
ASCII
subset.
Officially, this is the first
block
in Unicode,
Basic Latin
.
For details, see the
C0 Controls and Basic Latin
code chart.
This block was based on older 7-bit character code standards such as
ANSI X3.4-1977, ISO 646-1973, and
NIST FIPS 1-2
.
Â§
When to use this
The main advantage of this subset is that itâ€™s always valid UTF-8.  As such,
the
&[ascii::Char]
->
&str
conversion function (as well as other related
ones) are O(1):
no
runtime checks are needed.
If youâ€™re consuming strings, you should usually handle Unicode and thus
accept
str
s, not limit yourself to
ascii::Char
s.
However, certain formats are intentionally designed to produce ASCII-only
output in order to be 8-bit-clean.  In those cases, it can be simpler and
faster to generate
ascii::Char
s instead of dealing with the variable width
properties of general UTF-8 encoded strings, while still allowing the result
to be used freely with other Rust things that deal in general
str
s.
For example, a UUID library might offer a way to produce the string
representation of a UUID as an
[ascii::Char; 36]
to avoid memory
allocation yet still allow it to be used as UTF-8 via
as_str
without
paying for validation (or needing
unsafe
code) the way it would if it
were provided as a
[u8; 36]
.
Â§
Layout
This type is guaranteed to have a size and alignment of 1 byte.
Â§
Names
The variants on this type are
Unicode names
of the characters
in upper camel case, with a few tweaks:
For
<control>
characters, the primary alias name is used.
LATIN
is dropped, as this block has no non-latin letters.
LETTER
is dropped, as
CAPITAL
/
SMALL
suffices in this block.
DIGIT
s use a single digit rather than writing out
ZERO
,
ONE
, etc.

impl
AsciiChar
Source
pub const fn
from_u8
(b:
u8
) ->
Option
<
AsciiChar
>
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
ascii_char
#110998
)
Creates an ascii character from the byte
b
,
or returns
None
if itâ€™s too large.
Source
pub const unsafe fn
from_u8_unchecked
(b:
u8
) ->
AsciiChar
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
ascii_char
#110998
)
Creates an ASCII character from the byte
b
,
without checking whether itâ€™s valid.
Â§
Safety
b
must be in
0..=127
, or else this is UB.
Source
pub const fn
digit

When passed the
number
0
,
1
, â€¦,

'0'
,
'1'

'9'
respectively.
If

None
.
Source
pub const unsafe fn
digit_unchecked
(d:
u8
) ->
AsciiChar
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
ascii_char
#110998
)
When passed the
number
0
,
1
, â€¦,
9
, returns the
character
'0'
,
'1'
, â€¦,
'9'
respectively, without checking that itâ€™s in-range.
Â§
Safety
This is immediate UB if called with
d > 64
.
If
d >= 10
and
d <= 64
, this is allowed to return any value or panic.
Notably, it should not be expected to return hex digits, or any other
reasonable extension of the decimal digits.
(This loose safety condition is intended to simplify soundness proofs
when writing code using this method, since the implementation doesnâ€™t
need something really specific, not to make those other arguments do
something useful. It might be tightened before stabilization.)
