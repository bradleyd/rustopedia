Expand description
A clone-on-write smart pointer.
The type
Cow
is a smart pointer providing clone-on-write functionality: it
can enclose and provide immutable access to borrowed data, and clone the
data lazily when mutation or ownership is required. The type is designed to
work with general borrowed data via the
Borrow
trait.
Cow
implements
Deref
, which means that you can call
non-mutating methods directly on the data it encloses. If mutation
is desired,
to_mut
will obtain a mutable reference to an owned
value, cloning if necessary.
If you need reference-counting pointers, note that
Rc::make_mut
and
Arc::make_mut
can provide clone-on-write
functionality as well.

Examples
use
std::borrow::Cow;
fn
abs_all(input:
&mut
Cow<
'_
, [i32]>) {
for
i
in
0
..input.len() {
let
v = input[i];
if
v <
0
{
// Clones into a vector if not already owned.
input.to_mut()[i] = -v;
        }
    }
}
// No clone occurs because `input` doesn't need to be mutated.
let
slice = [
0
,
1
,
2
];
let
mut
input = Cow::from(
&
slice[..]);
abs_all(
&mut
input);
// Clone occurs because `input` needs to be mutated.
let
slice = [-
1
,
0
,
1
];
let
mut
input = Cow::from(
&
slice[..]);
abs_all(
&mut
input);
// No clone occurs because `input` is already owned.
let
mut
input = Cow::from(
vec!
[-
1

]);
abs_all(
&mut

Cow

where
[X]: ToOwned<Owned = Vec<X>> {
    values: Cow<

where

fn
new(v: Cow<
'a
, [X]>) ->
Self
{
        Items { values: v }
    }
}
// Creates a container from borrowed values of a slice
let
readonly = [
1
,
2
];
let
borrowed = Items::new((
&
readonly[..]).into());
match
borrowed {
    Items { values: Cow::Borrowed(b) } =>
println!
(
"borrowed {b:?}"
),
_
=>
panic!
(
"expect borrowed value"
),
}
let
mut
clone_on_write = borrowed;
// Mutates the data from slice into owned vec and pushes a new value on top
clone_on_write.values.to_mut().push(
3
);
println!
(
"clone_on_write = {:?}"
, clone_on_write.values);
// The data was mutated. Let's check it out.
match
clone_on_write {
    Items { values: Cow::Owned(
_
) } =>
println!
(
"clone_on_write contains owned data"
),

Acquires a mutable reference to the owned form of the data.

pub fn
into_owned

Owned
Extracts the owned data.
Clones the data if it is not already owned.
ยง
Examples
Calling
into_owned
on a
Cow::Borrowed
returns a clone of the borrowed data:
use
std::borrow::Cow;
let
s =
"Hello world!"
;
let
cow = Cow::Borrowed(s);
assert_eq!
(
  cow.into_owned(),
  String::from(s)
);
Calling
into_owned
on a
Cow::Owned
returns the owned data. The data is moved out of the
Cow
without being cloned.
use
std::borrow::Cow;
let
s =
"Hello world!"
;
let
cow: Cow<
'_
, str> = Cow::Owned(String::from(s));
assert_eq!
