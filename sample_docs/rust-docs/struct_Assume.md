alignment:
bool
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
transmutability
#99571
)
When
false
,
TransmuteFrom
is not implemented for transmutations
that might violate the alignment requirements of references; e.g.:
â“˜
#![feature(transmutability)]
use
core::mem::TransmuteFrom;
assert_eq!
(align_of::<[u8;

u16 =

When

,
TransmuteFrom
assumes that
you
have ensured
that references in the transmuted value satisfy the alignment
requirements of their referent types; e.g.:
#![feature(pointer_is_aligned_to, transmutability)]
use

lifetimes:
bool
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
transmutability

When

TransmuteFrom
is not implemented for transmutations
that extend the lifetimes of references.

TransmuteFrom
assumes that
you
have ensured that
references in the transmuted value do not outlive their referents.

safety:
bool
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
transmutability
#99571
)
When
false
,
TransmuteFrom
is not implemented for transmutations
that might violate the library safety invariants of the destination
type; e.g.:
â“˜
#![feature(transmutability)]
use
core::mem::TransmuteFrom;
let
src: u8 =

struct

// SAFETY: `val` must be an even number.

}
// SAFETY: No safety obligations.
let
dst: EvenU8 =
unsafe
{
    <
_ as
TransmuteFrom<
_
>>::transmute(src)
};
When
true
,
TransmuteFrom
assumes that
you
have ensured
that undefined behavior does not arise from using the transmuted value;
e.g.:
#![feature(transmutability)]
use
core::mem::{Assume, TransmuteFrom};
let

// SAFETY: `val` must be an even number.

Â§
validity:
bool
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
transmutability
#99571
)
When
false
,
TransmuteFrom
is not implemented for transmutations
that might violate the language-level bit-validity invariant of the
destination type; e.g.:
â“˜
#![feature(transmutability)]
use

let

3
;
// SAFETY: No safety obligations.
let
dst: bool =
unsafe

};
When
true
,
TransmuteFrom
assumes that
you
have ensured
that the value being transmuted is a bit-valid instance of the
transmuted value; e.g.:
#![feature(transmutability)]
use

let

Option
