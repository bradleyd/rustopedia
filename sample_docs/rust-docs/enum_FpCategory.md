pub enum FpCategory {
    Nan,
    Infinite,
    Zero,
    Subnormal,
    Normal,
}
Expand description
A classification of floating point numbers.
This
enum
is used as the return type for
f32::classify
and
f64::classify
. See
their documentation for more.

Examples
use
std::num::FpCategory;
let
num =
12.4_f32
;
let
inf = f32::INFINITY;
let
zero =
0f32
;
let
sub: f32 =
1.1754942e-38
;
let
nan = f32::NAN;
assert_eq!
(num.classify(), FpCategory::Normal);
assert_eq!
(inf.classify(), FpCategory::Infinite);
assert_eq!
(zero.classify(), FpCategory::Zero);
assert_eq!
(sub.classify(), FpCategory::Subnormal);
assert_eq!
(nan.classify(), FpCategory::Nan);
Variants
ยง
ยง
1.0.0
Nan
NaN (not a number): this value results from calculations like
(-1.0).sqrt()
.
See
the documentation for
f32
for more information on the unusual properties
of NaN.
ยง
1.0.0
Infinite
Positive or negative infinity, which often results from dividing a nonzero number
by zero.
ยง
1.0.0
Zero
Positive or negative zero.
See
the documentation for
f32
for more information on the signedness of zeroes.
ยง
1.0.0
Subnormal
โSubnormalโ or โdenormalโ floating point representation (less precise, relative to
their magnitude, than
Normal
).
Subnormal numbers are larger in magnitude than
Zero
but smaller in magnitude than all
Normal
numbers.
ยง
1.0.0
Normal
A regular floating point number, not any of the exceptional categories.
The smallest positive normal numbers are
f32::MIN_POSITIVE
and
f64::MIN_POSITIVE
,
and the largest positive normal numbers are
f32::MAX
and
f64::MAX
. (Unlike signed
integers, floating point numbers are symmetric in their range, so negating any of these
constants will produce their negative counterpart.)
