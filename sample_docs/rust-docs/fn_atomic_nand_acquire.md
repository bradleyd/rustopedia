Expand description
Bitwise nand with the current value, returning the previous value.
T
must be an integer or pointer type.
If
T
is a pointer type, the provenance of
src
is ignored: both the return value and the new
value stored at
*dst
will have the provenance of the old value stored there.
The stabilized version of this intrinsic is available on the
AtomicBool
type via the
fetch_nand
method by passing
Ordering::Acquire
as the
order
. For example,
AtomicBool::fetch_nand
.
