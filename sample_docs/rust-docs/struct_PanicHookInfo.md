set_hook
function.

pub fn
payload
(&self) -> &(dyn
Any
+
Send
)
Returns the payload associated with the panic.
This will commonly, but not always, be a
&'static str
or
String
.
A invocation of the
panic!()
macro in Rust 2021 or later will always result in a
panic payload of type
&'static str
or
String
.
Only an invocation of
panic_any
(or, in Rust 2018 and earlier,
panic!(x)
where
x
is something other than a string)
can result in a panic payload other than a
&'static str
or
String
.

Examples

(&self) ->

๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
panic_payload_as_str
#125175
)
Returns the payload associated with the panic, if it is a string.
This returns the payload if it is of type
&'static str
or
String
.
A invocation of the
panic!()
macro in Rust 2021 or later will always result in a
panic payload where
payload_as_str
returns
Some
.
Only an invocation of
panic_any
(or, in Rust 2018 and earlier,
panic!(x)
where
x
is something other than a string)
can result in a panic payload where
payload_as_str
returns
None
.

pub fn
location
(&self) ->
Option
<&
Location
<'_>>
Returns information about the location from which the panic originated,
if available.
This method will currently always return
Some
, but this may change
in future versions.

Examples
โ
use
std::panic;

panic::set_hook(Box::new(|panic_info| {
if let
Some
(location) = panic_info.location() {
println!
(
"panic occurred in file '{}' at line {}"
,
            location.file(),
            location.line(),
        );
    }
else
{
println!
(
"panic occurred but can't get location information..."
);
    }
}));
panic!
(
"Normal panic"
);
Source
pub fn
can_unwind
(&self) ->
bool
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
panic_can_unwind
#92988
)
Returns whether the panic handler is allowed to unwind the stack from
the point where the panic occurred.
This is true for most kinds of panics with the exception of panics
caused by trying to unwind out of a
Drop
implementation or a function
whose ABI does not support unwinding.
It is safe for a panic handler to unwind even when this function returns
false, however this will simply cause the panic handler to be called
again.
