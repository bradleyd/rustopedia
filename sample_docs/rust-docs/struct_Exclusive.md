Expand description
Exclusive
provides only
mutable
access, also referred to as
exclusive
access to the underlying value. It provides no
immutable
, or
shared
access to the underlying value.
While this may seem not very useful, it allows
Exclusive
to
unconditionally
implement
Sync
. Indeed, the safety requirements of
Sync
state that for
Exclusive
to be
Sync
, it must be sound to
share
across threads, that is, it must be sound
for
&Exclusive
to cross thread boundaries. By design, a
&Exclusive
has no API
whatsoever, making it useless, thus harmless, thus memory safe.
Certain constructs like
Future
s can only be used with
exclusive
access,
and are often
Send
but not
Sync
, so
Exclusive
can be used as hint to the
Rust compiler that something is
Sync
in practice.

Examples
Using a non-
Sync
future prevents the wrapping struct from being
Sync
โ
use
core::cell::Cell;
async fn
other() {}
fn
assert_sync<T: Sync>(t: T) {}
struct
State<F> {
    future: F
}

assert_sync(State {
    future:
async
{
let
cell = Cell::new(
1
);
let
cell_ref =
&
cell;
        other().
await
;
let
value = cell_ref.get();
    }
});
Exclusive
ensures the struct is
Sync
without stripping the future of its
functionality.
#![feature(exclusive_wrapper)]
use
core::cell::Cell;
use
core::sync::Exclusive;
async fn
other() {}
fn
assert_sync<T: Sync>(t: T) {}
struct
State<F> {
    future: Exclusive<F>
}

assert_sync(State {
    future: Exclusive::new(
async
{
let
cell = Cell::new(
1
);
let
cell_ref =
&
cell;
        other().
await
;
let
value = cell_ref.get();
    })
});

Parallels with a mutex
In some sense,
Exclusive
can be thought of as a
compile-time
version of
a mutex, as the borrow-checker guarantees that only one
&mut
can exist
for any value. This is a parallel with the fact that
&
and
&mut
references together can be thought of as a
compile-time
version of a read-write lock.

๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
exclusive_wrapper

Gets pinned exclusive access to the underlying value.
Exclusive
is considered to
structurally pin
the underlying
value, which means
unpinned
Exclusive
s can produce
unpinned
access to the underlying value, but
pinned
Exclusive
s only
produce
pinned
access to the underlying value.
