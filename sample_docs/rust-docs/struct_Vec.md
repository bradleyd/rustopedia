Expand description
A contiguous growable array type, written as
Vec<T>
, short for ‘vector’.
§
Examples
let
mut
vec = Vec::new();
vec.push(
1
);
vec.push(
2
);
assert_eq!
(vec.len(),
2
);
assert_eq!
(vec[
0
],
1
);
assert_eq!
(vec.pop(),
Some
(
2
));
assert_eq!
(vec.len(),
1
);

vec[
0
] =
7
;
assert_eq!
(vec[
0
],
7
);

vec.extend([
1
,
2
,
3
]);
for
x
in
&
vec {
println!
(
"{x}"
);
}
assert_eq!
(vec, [
7
,
1
,
2
,
3
]);
The
vec!
macro is provided for convenient initialization:
let
mut
vec1 =
vec!
[
1
,
2
,
3
];
vec1.push(
4
);
let
vec2 = Vec::from([
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
]);
assert_eq!
(vec1, vec2);
It can also initialize each element of a
Vec<T>
with a given value.
This may be more efficient than performing allocation and initialization
in separate steps, especially when initializing a vector of zeros:
let
vec =
vec!
[
0
;
5
];
assert_eq!
(vec, [
0
,
0
,
0
,
0
,
0
]);
// The following is equivalent, but potentially slower:
let
mut
vec = Vec::with_capacity(
5
);
vec.resize(
5
,
0
);
assert_eq!
(vec, [
0
,
0
,
0
,
0
,
0
]);
For more information, see
Capacity and Reallocation
.
Use a
Vec<T>
as an efficient stack:
let
mut
stack = Vec::new();

stack.push(
1
);
stack.push(
2
);
stack.push(
3
);
while let
Some
(top) = stack.pop() {
// Prints 3, 2, 1
println!
(
"{top}"
);
}
§
Indexing
The
Vec
type allows access to values by index, because it implements the
Index
trait. An example will be more explicit:
let
v =
vec!
[
0
,
2
,
4
,
6
];
println!
(
"{}"
, v[
1
]);
// it will display '2'
However be careful: if you try to access an index which isn’t in the
Vec
,
your software will panic! You cannot do this:
ⓘ
let
v =
vec!
[
0
,
2
,
4
,
6
];
println!
(
"{}"
, v[
6
]);
// it will panic!
Use
get
and
get_mut
if you want to check whether the index is in
the
Vec
.
§
Slicing
A
Vec
can be mutable. On the other hand, slices are read-only objects.
To get a
slice
, use
&
. Example:
fn
read_slice(slice:
&
[usize]) {
// ...
}
let
v =
vec!
[
0
,
1
];
read_slice(
&
v);
// ... and that's all!
// you can also do it like this:
let
u:
&
[usize] =
&
v;
// or like this:
let
u:
&
[
_
] =
&
v;
In Rust, it’s more common to pass slices as arguments rather than vectors
when you just want to provide read access. The same goes for
String
and
&str
.
§
Capacity and reallocation
The capacity of a vector is the amount of space allocated for any future
elements that will be added onto the vector. This is not to be confused with
the
length
of a vector, which specifies the number of actual elements
within the vector. If a vector’s length exceeds its capacity, its capacity
will automatically be increased, but its elements will have to be
reallocated.
For example, a vector with capacity 10 and length 0 would be an empty vector
with space for 10 more elements. Pushing 10 or fewer elements onto the
vector will not change its capacity or cause reallocation to occur. However,
if the vector’s length is increased to 11, it will have to reallocate, which
can be slow. For this reason, it is recommended to use
Vec::with_capacity
whenever possible to specify how big the vector is expected to get.
§
Guarantees
Due to its incredibly fundamental nature,
Vec
makes a lot of guarantees
about its design. This ensures that it’s as low-overhead as possible in
the general case, and can be correctly manipulated in primitive ways
by unsafe code. Note that these guarantees refer to an unqualified
Vec<T>
.
If additional type parameters are added (e.g., to support custom allocators),
overriding their defaults may change the behavior.
Most fundamentally,
Vec
is and always will be a (pointer, capacity, length)
triplet. No more, no less. The order of these fields is completely
unspecified, and you should use the appropriate methods to modify these.
The pointer will never be null, so this type is null-pointer-optimized.
However, the pointer might not actually point to allocated memory. In particular,
if you construct a
Vec
with capacity 0 via
Vec::new
,
vec![]
,
Vec::with_capacity(0)
, or by calling
shrink_to_fit
on an empty Vec, it will not allocate memory. Similarly, if you store zero-sized
types inside a
Vec
, it will not allocate space for them.
Note that in this case
the
Vec
might not report a
capacity
of 0
.
Vec
will allocate if and only
if
size_of::<T>
() *
capacity
() > 0
. In general,
Vec
’s allocation
details are very subtle — if you intend to allocate memory using a
Vec
and use it for something else (either to pass to unsafe code, or to build your
own memory-backed collection), be sure to deallocate this memory by using
from_raw_parts
to recover the
Vec
and then dropping it.
If a
Vec
has
allocated memory, then the memory it points to is on the heap
(as defined by the allocator Rust is configured to use by default), and its
pointer points to
len
initialized, contiguous elements in order (what
you would see if you coerced it to a slice), followed by
capacity
-
len
logically uninitialized, contiguous elements.
A vector containing the elements
'a'
and
'b'
with capacity 4 can be
visualized as below. The top part is the
Vec
struct, it contains a
pointer to the head of the allocation in the heap, length and capacity.
The bottom part is the allocation on the heap, a contiguous memory block.
ptr      len  capacity
       +--------+--------+--------+
       | 0x0123 |      2 |      4 |
       +--------+--------+--------+
            |
            v
Heap   +--------+--------+--------+--------+
       |    'a' |    'b' | uninit | uninit |
       +--------+--------+--------+--------+
uninit
represents memory that is not initialized, see
MaybeUninit
.
Note: the ABI is not stable and
Vec
makes no guarantees about its memory
layout (including the order of fields).
Vec
will never perform a “small optimization” where elements are actually
stored on the stack for two reasons:
It would make it more difficult for unsafe code to correctly manipulate
a
Vec
. The contents of a
Vec
wouldn’t have a stable address if it were
only moved, and it would be more difficult to determine if a
Vec
had
actually allocated memory.
It would penalize the general case, incurring an additional branch
on every access.
Vec
will never automatically shrink itself, even if completely empty. This
ensures no unnecessary allocations or deallocations occur. Emptying a
Vec
and then filling it back up to the same
len
should incur no calls to
the allocator. If you wish to free up unused memory, use
shrink_to_fit
or
shrink_to
.
push
and
insert
will never (re)allocate if the reported capacity is
sufficient.
push
and
insert
will
(re)allocate if
len
==
capacity
. That is, the reported capacity is completely
accurate, and can be relied on. It can even be used to manually free the memory
allocated by a
Vec
if desired. Bulk insertion methods
may
reallocate, even
when not necessary.
Vec
does not guarantee any particular growth strategy when reallocating
when full, nor when
reserve
is called. The current strategy is basic
and it may prove desirable to use a non-constant growth factor. Whatever
strategy is used will of course guarantee
O
(1) amortized
push
.
It is guaranteed, in order to respect the intentions of the programmer, that
all of
vec![e_1, e_2, ..., e_n]
,
vec![x; n]
, and
Vec::with_capacity(n)
produce a
Vec
that requests an allocation of the exact size needed for precisely
n
elements from the allocator,
and no other size (such as, for example: a size rounded up to the nearest power of 2).
The allocator will return an allocation that is at least as large as requested, but it may be larger.
It is guaranteed that the
Vec::capacity
method returns a value that is at least the requested capacity
and not more than the allocated capacity.
The method
Vec::shrink_to_fit
will attempt to discard excess capacity an allocator has given to a
Vec
.
If
len
==
capacity
, then a
Vec<T>
can be converted
to and from a
Box<[T]>
without reallocating or moving the elements.
Vec
exploits this fact as much as reasonable when implementing common conversions
such as
into_boxed_slice
.
Vec
will not specifically overwrite any data that is removed from it,
but also won’t specifically preserve it. Its uninitialized memory is
scratch space that it may use however it wants. It will generally just do
whatever is most efficient or otherwise easy to implement. Do not rely on
removed data to be erased for security purposes. Even if you drop a
Vec
, its
buffer may simply be reused by another allocation. Even if you zero a
Vec
’s memory
first, that might not actually happen because the optimizer does not consider
this a side-effect that must be preserved. There is one case which we will
not break, however: using
unsafe
code to write to the excess capacity,
and then increasing the length to match, is always valid.
Currently,
Vec
does not guarantee the order in which elements are dropped.
The order has changed in the past and may change again.

from_raw_parts
(
    ptr:
*mut T
,

,
    capacity:
usize
,
) ->
Vec
<T>
Creates a
Vec<T>
directly from a pointer, a length, and a capacity.
§
Safety
This is highly unsafe, due to the number of invariants that aren’t
checked:
ptr
must have been allocated using the global allocator, such as via
the
alloc::alloc
function.
T
needs to have the same alignment as what
ptr
was allocated with.
(
T
having a less strict alignment is not sufficient, the alignment really
needs to be equal to satisfy the
dealloc
requirement that memory must be
allocated and deallocated with the same layout.)
The size of
T
times the
capacity
(ie. the allocated size in bytes) needs
to be the same size as the pointer was allocated with. (Because similar to
alignment,
dealloc
must be called with the same layout
size
.)
length
needs to be less than or equal to
capacity
.
The first
length
values must be properly initialized values of type
T
.
capacity
needs to be the capacity that the pointer was allocated with.
The allocated size in bytes must be no larger than
isize::MAX
.
See the safety documentation of
pointer::offset
.
These requirements are always upheld by any
ptr
that has been allocated
via
Vec<T>
. Other allocation sources are allowed if the invariants are
upheld.
Violating these may cause problems like corrupting the allocator’s
internal data structures. For example it is normally
not
safe
to build a
Vec<u8>
from a pointer to a C
char
array with length
size_t
, doing so is only safe if the array was initially allocated by
a
Vec
or
String
.
It’s also not safe to build one from a
Vec<u16>
and its length, because
the allocator cares about the alignment, and these two types have different
alignments. The buffer was allocated with alignment 2 (for
u16
), but after
turning it into a
Vec<u8>
it’ll be deallocated with alignment 1. To avoid
these issues, it is often preferable to do casting/transmuting using
slice::from_raw_parts
instead.
The ownership of
ptr
is effectively transferred to the
Vec<T>
which may then deallocate, reallocate or change the
contents of memory pointed to by the pointer at will. Ensure
that nothing else uses the pointer after calling this
function.

T
having a less strict alignment is not sufficient, the alignment really
needs to be equal to satisfy the
dealloc
requirement that memory must be
allocated and deallocated with the same layout.)
The size of
T
times the
capacity
(ie. the allocated size in bytes) needs
to be the same size as the pointer was allocated with. (Because similar to
alignment,
dealloc
must be called with the same layout
size
.)
length
needs to be less than or equal to
capacity
.
The first
length
values must be properly initialized values of type
T
.
capacity
needs to
fit
the layout size that the pointer was allocated with.
The allocated size in bytes must be no larger than
isize::MAX
.
See the safety documentation of
pointer::offset
.
These requirements are always upheld by any
ptr
that has been allocated
via
Vec<T, A>
. Other allocation sources are allowed if the invariants are
upheld.
Violating these may cause problems like corrupting the allocator’s
internal data structures. For example it is
not
safe
to build a
Vec<u8>
from a pointer to a C
char
array with length
size_t
.
It’s also not safe to build one from a
Vec<u16>
and its length, because
the allocator cares about the alignment, and these two types have different
alignments. The buffer was allocated with alignment 2 (for
u16
), but after
turning it into a
Vec<u8>
it’ll be deallocated with alignment 1.
The ownership of
ptr
is effectively transferred to the
Vec<T>
which may then deallocate, reallocate or change the
contents of memory pointed to by the pointer at will. Ensure
that nothing else uses the pointer after calling this
function.

Shortens the vector, keeping the first
len
elements and dropping
the rest.
If
len
is greater or equal to the vector’s current length, this has
no effect.
The
drain
method can emulate
truncate
, but causes the excess
elements to be returned instead of dropped.

of the vector.

pub const fn
as_ptr
(&self) ->
*const T
Returns a raw pointer to the vector’s buffer, or a dangling raw pointer
valid for zero sized reads if the vector didn’t allocate.
The caller must ensure that the vector outlives the pointer this
function returns, or else it will end up dangling.
Modifying the vector may cause its buffer to be reallocated,
which would also make any pointers to it invalid.
The caller must also ensure that the memory the pointer (non-transitively) points to
is never written to (except inside an
UnsafeCell
) using this pointer or any pointer
derived from it. If you need to mutate the contents of the slice, use
as_mut_ptr
.
This method guarantees that for the purpose of the aliasing model, this method
does not materialize a reference to the underlying slice, and thus the returned pointer
will remain valid when mixed with other calls to
as_ptr
,
as_mut_ptr
,
and
as_non_null
.
Note that calling other methods that materialize mutable references to the slice,
or mutable references to specific elements you are planning on accessing through this pointer,
as well as writing to those elements, may still invalidate this pointer.
See the second example below for how this guarantee can be used.
§
Examples
let
x =
vec!
[
1
,
2
,
4
];
let
x_ptr = x.as_ptr();
unsafe
{
for
i
in
0
..x.len() {
assert_eq!
(
*
x_ptr.add(i),
1
<< i);

}
Due to the aliasing guarantee, the following code is legal:
unsafe
{
let
mut
v =
vec!
[
0
,
1
,
2
];
let
ptr1 = v.as_ptr();
let _
= ptr1.read();
let
ptr2 = v.as_mut_ptr().offset(
2
);
    ptr2.write(
2
);
// Notably, the write to `ptr2` did *not* invalidate `ptr1`
    // because it mutated a different element:
let _
= ptr1.read();

pub const fn
as_mut_ptr
(&mut self) ->
*mut T
Returns a raw mutable pointer to the vector’s buffer, or a dangling
raw pointer valid for zero sized reads if the vector didn’t allocate.
The caller must ensure that the vector outlives the pointer this
function returns, or else it will end up dangling.
Modifying the vector may cause its buffer to be reallocated,
which would also make any pointers to it invalid.
This method guarantees that for the purpose of the aliasing model, this method
does not materialize a reference to the underlying slice, and thus the returned pointer
will remain valid when mixed with other calls to
as_ptr
,
as_mut_ptr
,
and
as_non_null
.
Note that calling other methods that materialize references to the slice,
or references to specific elements you are planning on accessing through this pointer,
may still invalidate this pointer.
See the second example below for how this guarantee can be used.

pub unsafe fn
set_len
(&mut self, new_len:
usize
)
Forces the length of the vector to
new_len
.
This is a low-level operation that maintains none of the normal
invariants of the type. Normally changing the length of a vector
is done using one of the safe operations instead, such as
truncate
,
resize
,
extend
, or
clear
.
§
Safety
new_len
must be less than or equal to
capacity()
.
The elements at
old_len..new_len
must be initialized.
§
Examples
See
spare_capacity_mut()
for an example with safe
initialization of capacity elements and use of this method.
set_len()
can be useful for situations in which the vector
is serving as a buffer for other code, particularly over FFI:
pub fn
get_dictionary(
&
self
) ->
Option
<Vec<u8>> {
// Per the FFI method's docs, "32768 bytes is always enough".
let
mut
dict = Vec::with_capacity(
32_768
);
let
mut
dict_length =
0
;
// SAFETY: When `deflateGetDictionary` returns `Z_OK`, it holds that:
    // 1. `dict_length` elements were initialized.
    // 2. `dict_length` <= the capacity (32_768)
    // which makes `set_len` safe to call.
unsafe
{
// Make the FFI call...
let
r = deflateGetDictionary(
self
.strm, dict.as_mut_ptr(),
&mut
dict_length);
if
r == Z_OK {
// ...and update the length to what was initialized.
dict.set_len(dict_length);
Some
(dict)
        }
else
{
None
}
    }
}
While the following example is sound, there is a memory leak since
the inner vectors were not freed prior to the
set_len
call:
let
mut
vec =
vec!
[
vec!
[
1
,
0
,
0
],
vec!
[
0
,
1
,
0
],
vec!
[
0
,
0
,
1
]];
// SAFETY:
// 1. `old_len..0` is empty so no elements need to be initialized.
// 2. `0 <= capacity` always holds whatever `capacity` is.
unsafe
{
    vec.set_len(
0
);
}
Normally, here, one would use
clear
instead to correctly drop
the contents and thus not leak memory.

split_at_spare_mut
(&mut self) -> (&mut

, &mut [

<T>])
🔬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
vec_split_at_spare
#81944
)
Returns vector content as a slice of
T
, along with the remaining spare
capacity of the vector as a slice of
MaybeUninit<T>
.
The returned spare capacity slice can be used to fill the vector with data
(e.g. by reading from a file) before marking the data as initialized using
the
set_len
method.
Note that this is a low-level API, which should be used with care for
optimization purposes. If you need to append data to a
Vec
you can use
push
,
extend
,
extend_from_slice
,
extend_from_within
,
insert
,
append
,
resize
or
resize_with
, depending on your exact needs.

pub fn
resize
(&mut self, new_len:
usize
, value: T)
Resizes the
Vec
in-place so that
len
is equal to
new_len
.
If
new_len
is greater than
len
, the
Vec
is extended by the
difference, with each additional slot filled with
value
.
If
new_len
is less than
len
, the
Vec
is simply truncated.
This method requires
T
to implement
Clone
,
in order to be able to clone the passed value.
If you need more flexibility (or want to rely on
Default
instead of
Clone
), use
Vec::resize_with
.
If you only need to resize to a smaller size, use
Vec::truncate
.

mut

pub fn
extend_from_slice
(&mut self, other: &
[T]
)
Clones and appends all elements in a slice to the
Vec
.
Iterates over the slice
other
, clones each element, and then appends
it to this
Vec
. The
other
slice is traversed in-order.
Note that this function is the same as
extend
,
except that it also works with slice elements that are Clone but not Copy.
If Rust gets specialization this function may be deprecated.

Panics
Panics if the length of the resulting vector would overflow a

This is only possible when flattening a vector of arrays of zero-sized
types, and thus tends to be irrelevant in practice. If
size_of::<T>() > 0
, this will never panic.

where

<Item = T>,
Creates a splicing iterator that replaces the specified range in the vector
with the given
replace_with
iterator and yields the removed items.
replace_with
does not need to be the same length as
range
.
range
is removed even if the
Splice
iterator is not consumed before it is dropped.
It is unspecified how many elements are removed from the vector
if the
Splice
value is leaked.
The input iterator
replace_with
is only consumed when the
Splice
value is dropped.
This is optimal if:
The tail (elements in the vector after
range
) is empty,
or
replace_with
yields fewer or equal elements than
range
’s length
or the lower bound of its
size_hint()
is exact.
Otherwise, a temporary vector is allocated and the tail is moved twice.
§
Panics
Panics if the starting point is greater than the end point or if
the end point is greater than the length of the vector.

ⓘ
where
    F:
FnMut
(

,
    R:
RangeBounds
<
usize
>,
Creates an iterator which uses a closure to determine if element in the range should be removed.
If the closure returns true, then the element is removed and yielded.
If the closure returns false, the element will remain in the vector and will not be yielded
by the iterator.
Only elements that fall in the provided range are considered for extraction, but any elements
after the range will still have to be moved if any element has been extracted.
If the returned
ExtractIf
is not exhausted, e.g. because it is dropped without iterating
or the iteration short-circuits, then the remaining elements will be retained.
Use
retain
with a negated predicate if you do not need the returned iterator.
Using this method is equivalent to the following code:
let
mut
i = range.start;
while
i < min(vec.len(), range.end) {
if
some_predicate(
&mut
vec[i]) {
let
val = vec.remove(i);
// your code here
}
else
{
        i +=
1
;
    }
}
But
extract_if
is easier to use.
extract_if
is also more efficient,
because it can backshift the elements of the array in bulk.
Note that
extract_if
also lets you mutate the elements passed to the filter closure,
regardless of whether you choose to keep or remove them.

as_ptr
(&self) ->

Returns a raw pointer to the slice’s buffer.
The caller must ensure that the slice outlives the pointer this
function returns, or else it will end up dangling.
The caller must also ensure that the memory the pointer (non-transitively) points to
is never written to (except inside an
UnsafeCell
) using this pointer or any pointer
derived from it. If you need to mutate the contents of the slice, use
as_mut_ptr

to be reallocated, which would also make any pointers to it invalid.

Range

ⓘ
Returns the two raw pointers spanning the slice.
The returned range is half-open, which means that the end pointer
points
one past
the last element of the slice. This way, an empty
slice is represented by two equal pointers, and the difference between
the two pointers represents the size of the slice.
See
as_ptr
for warnings on using these pointers. The end pointer
requires extra caution, as it does not point to a valid element in the
slice.
This function is useful for interacting with foreign interfaces which
use two pointers to refer to a range of elements in memory, as is
common in C++.
It can also be useful to check if a pointer to an element refers to an
element of this slice:

This is a nightly-only experimental API. (

Returns an iterator over
N
elements of the slice at a time, starting at the
beginning of the slice.
The chunks are array references and do not overlap. If
N
does not divide the
length of the slice, then the last up to
N-1
elements will be omitted and can be
retrieved from the
remainder
function of the iterator.
This method is the const generic equivalent of
chunks_exact

uniquely determined position; the second and third are not
found; the fourth could match any position in

If you want to find that whole
range
of matching items, rather than
an arbitrary matching one, that can be done using
partition_point
:
let
s = [

,
2
,
3

];
let
low = s.partition_point(|x| x <
&
1
);
assert_eq!
(low,
1
);
let
high = s.partition_point(|x| x <=
&
1
);
assert_eq!
(high,
5
);
let
r = s.binary_search(
&
1
);
assert!
((low..high).contains(
&
r.unwrap()));
assert!
(s[..low].iter().all(|
&
x| x <
1
));
assert!
(s[low..high].iter().all(|
&
x| x ==
1
));
assert!
(s[high..].iter().all(|
&
x| x >
1
));
// For something not found, the "range" of equal items is empty
assert_eq!
(s.partition_point(|x| x <
&
11
),
9
);
assert_eq!
(s.partition_point(|x| x <=
&
11
),
9
);
assert_eq!
(s.binary_search(
&
11
),
Err
(
9
));
If you want to insert an item to a sorted vector, while maintaining
sort order, consider using
partition_point
:
let
mut
s =
vec!
[
0
,
1
,
1
,
1
,
1
,
2
,
3

13
,
21
,
34
,
55
];
let
num =
42
;
let
idx = s.partition_point(|
&
x| x <= num);
// If `num` is unique, `s.partition_point(|&x| x < num)` (with `<`) is equivalent to
// `s.binary_search(&num).unwrap_or_else(|x| x)`, but using `<=` will allow `insert`
// to shift less elements.
s.insert(idx, num);
assert_eq!
(s, [
0
,
1

pub fn
sort_unstable
(&mut self)
where
    T:
Ord
,
Sorts the slice
without
preserving the initial order of equal elements.
This sort is unstable (i.e., may reorder equal elements), in-place (i.e., does not
allocate), and
O
(
n
* log(
n
)) worst-case.
If the implementation of
Ord
for
T
does not implement a
total order
, the function
may panic; even if the function exits normally, the resulting order of elements in the slice
is unspecified. See also the note on panicking below.
For example
|a, b| (a - b).cmp(a)
is a comparison function that is neither transitive nor
reflexive nor total,
a < b < c < a
with
a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
. For more information and
examples see the
Ord
documentation.
All original elements will remain in the slice and any possible modifications via interior
mutability are observed in the input. Same is true if the implementation of
Ord
for
T
panics.
Sorting types that only implement
PartialOrd
such as
f32
and
f64
require
additional precautions. For example,
f32::NAN != f32::NAN
, which doesn’t fulfill the
reflexivity requirement of
Ord
. By using an alternative comparison function with
slice::sort_unstable_by
such as
f32::total_cmp
or
f64::total_cmp
that defines a
total order
users can sort slices containing floating-point values. Alternatively, if all
values in the slice are guaranteed to be in a subset for which
PartialOrd::partial_cmp
forms a
total order
, it’s possible to sort the slice with
sort_unstable_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())
.
§
Current implementation
The current implementation is based on
ipnsort
by Lukas Bergdoll and Orson Peters, which
combines the fast average case of quicksort with the fast worst case of heapsort, achieving
linear time on fully sorted and reversed inputs. On inputs with k distinct elements, the
expected time to sort the data is
O
(
n
* log(
k

It is typically faster than stable sorting, except in a few special cases, e.g., when the
slice is partially sorted.

This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
slice_partition_dedup
#54279
)
Moves all but the first of consecutive elements to the end of the slice satisfying
a given equality relation.
Returns two slices. The first contains no consecutive repeated elements.
The second contains all the duplicates in no specified order.
The
same_bucket
function is passed references to two elements from the slice and
must determine if the elements compare equal. The elements are passed in opposite order
from their order in the slice, so if
same_bucket(a, b)
returns
true
,
a
is moved
at the end of the slice.
If the slice is sorted, the first returned slice contains no duplicates.

Returns the index of the partition point according to the given predicate

The slice is assumed to be partitioned according to the given predicate.
This means that all elements for which the predicate returns true are at the start of the slice
and all elements for which the predicate returns false are at the end.
For example,
[7, 15, 3, 5, 4, 12, 6]
is partitioned under the predicate
x % 2 != 0
(all odd numbers are at the start, all even at the end).
If this slice is not partitioned, the returned result is unspecified and meaningless,
as this method performs a kind of binary search.

is empty, then the length of the slice will be returned:

Returns mutable references to many indices at once, without doing any checks.
An index can be either a

. Note
that this method takes an array, so all indices must be of the same type.
If passed an array of

Returns an error if any index is out-of-bounds, or if there are overlapping indices.
An empty range is not considered to overlap if it is located at the beginning or at
the end of another range, but is considered to overlap if it is located in the middle.
This method does a O(n^2) check to check that there are no overlapping indices, so be careful

pub fn
sort
(&mut self)
where
    T:
Ord
,
Sorts the slice, preserving initial order of equal elements.
This sort is stable (i.e., does not reorder equal elements) and
O

worst-case.
If the implementation of
Ord
for
T
does not implement a
total order
, the function
may panic; even if the function exits normally, the resulting order of elements in the slice
is unspecified. See also the note on panicking below.
When applicable, unstable sorting is preferred because it is generally faster than stable
sorting and it doesn’t allocate auxiliary memory. See
sort_unstable
. The exception are partially sorted slices, which
may be better served with
slice::sort
.
Sorting types that only implement
PartialOrd
such as
f32
and
f64
require
additional precautions. For example,
f32::NAN != f32::NAN
, which doesn’t fulfill the
reflexivity requirement of
Ord
. By using an alternative comparison function with
slice::sort_by
such as
f32::total_cmp
or
f64::total_cmp
that defines a
total
order
users can sort slices containing floating-point values. Alternatively, if all values
in the slice are guaranteed to be in a subset for which
PartialOrd::partial_cmp
forms a
total order
, it’s possible to sort the slice with
sort_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())
.
§
Current implementation
The current implementation is based on
driftsort
by Orson Peters and Lukas Bergdoll, which
combines the fast average case of quicksort with the fast worst case and partial run
detection of mergesort, achieving linear time on fully sorted and reversed inputs. On inputs
with k distinct elements, the expected time to sort the data is
O
(
n
* log(
k
)).
The auxiliary memory allocation behavior depends on the input length. Short slices are
handled without allocation, medium sized slices allocate
self.len()
and beyond that it
clamps at
self.len() / 2
.
§
Panics
May panic if the implementation of
Ord
for
T
does not implement a
total order
, or if
the
Ord
implementation itself panics.
All safe functions on slices preserve the invariant that even if the function panics, all
original elements will remain in the slice and any possible modifications via interior
mutability are observed in the input. This ensures that recovery code (for instance inside
of a
Drop
or following a
catch_unwind
) will still have access to all the original
elements. For instance, if the slice belongs to a
Vec
, the
Vec::drop
method will be able
to dispose of all contained elements.

sort_by_cached_key
<K, F>(&mut self, f: F)
where
    F:
FnMut
(
&T
) -> K,
    K:
Ord
,
Sorts the slice with a key extraction function, preserving initial order of equal elements.
This sort is stable (i.e., does not reorder equal elements) and
O
(
m
*
n
+
n
*
log(
n
)) worst-case, where the key function is
O
(
m
).
During sorting, the key function is called at most once per element, by using temporary
storage to remember the results of key evaluation. The order of calls to the key function is
unspecified and may change in future versions of the standard library.
If the implementation of
Ord
for
K
does not implement a
total order
, the function
may panic; even if the function exits normally, the resulting order of elements in the slice
is unspecified. See also the note on panicking below.
For simple key functions (e.g., functions that are property accesses or basic operations),
sort_by_key
is likely to be faster.
§
Current implementation
The current implementation is based on
instruction-parallel-network sort
by Lukas
Bergdoll, which combines the fast average case of randomized quicksort with the fast worst
case of heapsort, while achieving linear time on fully sorted and reversed inputs. And
O
(
k
* log(
n
)) where
k
is the number of distinct elements in the input. It leverages
superscalar out-of-order execution capabilities commonly found in CPUs, to efficiently
perform the operation.
In the worst case, the algorithm allocates temporary storage in a
Vec<(K, usize)>
the
length of the slice.
§
Panics
May panic if the implementation of
Ord
for
K
does not implement a
total order
, or if
the
Ord
implementation panics.
All safe functions on slices preserve the invariant that even if the function panics, all
original elements will remain in the slice and any possible modifications via interior
mutability are observed in the input. This ensures that recovery code (for instance inside
of a
Drop
or following a
catch_unwind
) will still have access to all the original
elements. For instance, if the slice belongs to a
Vec
, the
Vec::drop
method will be able
to dispose of all contained elements.

v = [

impl<T>
FromIterator
<T> for
Vec
<T>
Collects an iterator into a Vec, commonly called via
Iterator::collect()
§
Allocation behavior
In general
Vec
does not guarantee any particular growth or allocation strategy.
That also applies to this trait impl.
Note:
This section covers implementation details and is therefore exempt from
stability guarantees.
Vec may use any or none of the following strategies,
depending on the supplied iterator:
preallocate based on
Iterator::size_hint()
and panic if the number of items is outside the provided lower/upper bounds
use an amortized growth strategy similar to
pushing
one item at a time
perform the iteration in-place on the original allocation backing the iterator
The last case warrants some attention. It is an optimization that in many cases reduces peak memory
consumption and improves cache locality. But when big, short-lived allocations are created,
only a small fraction of their items get collected, no further use is made of the spare capacity
and the resulting
Vec
is moved into a longer-lived structure, then this can lead to the large
allocations having their lifetimes unnecessarily extended which can result in increased memory
footprint.
In cases where this is an issue, the excess capacity can be discarded with
Vec::shrink_to()
,
Vec::shrink_to_fit()
or by collecting into
Box<[T]>
instead, which additionally reduces
the size of the long-lived struct.
static
LONG_LIVED: Mutex<Vec<Vec<u16>>> = Mutex::new(Vec::new());
for
i
in
0
..
10
{
let
big_temporary: Vec<u16> = (
0
..
1024
).collect();
// discard most items
let
mut
result: Vec<
_
> = big_temporary.into_iter().filter(|i| i %
100
==
0
).collect();
// without this a lot of unused capacity might be moved into the global
result.shrink_to_fit();
    LONG_LIVED.lock().unwrap().push(result);
}
