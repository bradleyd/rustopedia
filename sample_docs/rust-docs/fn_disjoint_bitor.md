Expand description
Combine two values which have no bits in common.
This allows the backend to implement it as
a + b
or
a | b
,
depending which is easier to implement on a specific target.
Â§
Safety
Requires that
(a & b) == 0
, or equivalently that
(a | b) == (a + b)
.
Otherwise itâ€™s immediate UB.
