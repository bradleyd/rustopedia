Expand description
Hints to the compiler that current code path is cold.
Note that, unlike most intrinsics, this is safe to call;
it does not require an
unsafe
block.
Therefore, implementations must not require the user to uphold
any safety invariants.
This intrinsic does not have a stable counterpart.
