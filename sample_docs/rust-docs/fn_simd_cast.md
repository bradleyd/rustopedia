This is a nightly-only experimental API. (

Expand description
Numerically casts a vector, elementwise.
T
and
U
must be vectors of integers or floats, and must have the same length.
When casting floats to integers, the result is truncated. Out-of-bounds result lead to UB.
When casting integers to floats, the result is rounded.
Otherwise, truncates or extends the value, maintaining the sign for signed integers.
Â§
Safety
Casting from integer types is always safe.
Casting between two float types is also always safe.
Casting floats to integers truncates, following the same rules as
to_int_unchecked
.
Specifically, each element must:
Not be
NaN
Not be infinite
Be representable in the return type, after truncating off its fractional part
