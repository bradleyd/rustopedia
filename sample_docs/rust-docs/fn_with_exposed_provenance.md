pub fn with_exposed_provenance<T>(addr:
usize
) ->
*const T
Expand description
Converts an address back to a pointer, picking up some previously ‘exposed’
provenance
.
This is fully equivalent to
addr as *const T
. The provenance of the returned pointer is that
of
some
pointer that was previously exposed by passing it to
expose_provenance
, or a
ptr as usize
cast. In addition, memory
which is outside the control of the Rust abstract machine (MMIO registers, for example) is
always considered to be accessible with an exposed provenance, so long as this memory is disjoint
from memory that will be used by the abstract machine such as the stack, heap, and statics.
The exact provenance that gets picked is not specified. The compiler will do its best to pick
the “right” provenance for you (whatever that may be), but currently we cannot provide any
guarantees about which provenance the resulting pointer will have – and therefore there
is no definite specification for which memory the resulting pointer may access.
If there is
no
previously ‘exposed’ provenance that justifies the way the returned pointer
will be used, the program has undefined behavior. In particular, the aliasing rules still apply:
pointers and references that have been invalidated due to aliasing accesses cannot be used
anymore, even if they have been exposed!
Due to its inherent ambiguity, this operation may not be supported by tools that help you to
stay conformant with the Rust memory model. It is recommended to use
Strict
Provenance
APIs such as
with_addr
wherever
possible.
On most platforms this will produce a value with the same bytes as the address. Platforms
which need to store additional information in a pointer may not support this operation,
since it is generally not possible to actually
compute
which provenance the returned
pointer has to pick up.
This is an
Exposed Provenance
API.
