Expand description
A possible error value when converting a
String
from a UTF-8 byte vector.
This type is the error type for the
from_utf8
method on
String
. It
is designed in such a way to carefully avoid reallocations: the
into_bytes
method will give back the byte vector that was used in the
conversion attempt.
The
Utf8Error
type provided by
std::str
represents an error that may
occur when converting a slice of
u8
s to a
&str
. In this sense, itâ€™s
an analogue to
FromUtf8Error
, and you can get one from a
FromUtf8Error
through the
utf8_error
method.
Â§
Examples
// some invalid bytes, in a vector
let
bytes =
vec!
[
0
,
159
];
let
value = String::from_utf8(bytes);
assert!
(value.is_err());
assert_eq!
(
vec!
[
0
,
159
], value.unwrap_err().into_bytes());

pub fn
as_bytes
(&self) -> &[

â“˜
Returns a slice of
u8
s bytes that were attempted to convert to a
String
.

Examples
// some invalid bytes, in a vector
let
bytes =
vec!
[
0
,
159

let
value = String::from_utf8(bytes);

pub fn
into_utf8_lossy
(self) ->
String
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
string_from_utf8_lossy_owned
#129436
)
Converts the bytes into a
String
lossily, substituting invalid UTF-8
sequences with replacement characters.
See
String::from_utf8_lossy
for more details on replacement of
invalid sequences, and
String::from_utf8_lossy_owned
for the
String
function which corresponds to this function.
Â§
Examples
#![feature(string_from_utf8_lossy_owned)]
// some invalid bytes
let
input: Vec<u8> =
b"Hello \xF0\x90\x80World"
.into();
let
output = String::from_utf8(input).unwrap_or_else(|e| e.into_utf8_lossy());
assert_eq!
(String::from(
"Hello ï¿½World"
), output);

pub fn
into_bytes
(self) ->
Vec
<
u8
>
â“˜
Returns the bytes that were attempted to convert to a
String
.
This method is carefully constructed to avoid allocation. It will
consume the error, moving out the bytes, so that a copy of the bytes
does not need to be made.
Â§
Examples
// some invalid bytes, in a vector
let
bytes =
vec!
[
0
,
159
];
let
value = String::from_utf8(bytes);
assert_eq!
(
vec!
[
0
,
159
], value.unwrap_err().into_bytes());
