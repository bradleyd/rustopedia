This is a nightly-only experimental API. (

#125687
)
Expand description
A range only bounded exclusively above (
..end
).
The
RangeTo
..end
contains all values with
x < end
.
It cannot serve as an
Iterator
because it doesnâ€™t have a starting point.
Â§
Examples
The
..end
syntax is a
RangeTo
:
assert_eq!
((..
5
), std::ops::RangeTo { end:
5
});
It does not have an
IntoIterator
implementation, so you canâ€™t use it in
a
for
loop directly. This wonâ€™t compile:
â“˜
// error[E0277]: the trait bound `std::ops::RangeTo<{integer}>:
// std::iter::Iterator` is not satisfied
for
i
in
..
5
{
// ...
}
When used as a
slicing index
,
RangeTo
produces a slice of all array
elements before the index indicated by
end
.
let
arr = [
0
,
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
];
assert_eq!
(arr[ ..  ], [
0
,
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
]);
assert_eq!
(arr[ ..
3
], [
0
,
1
,
2
]);
// This is a `RangeTo`
assert_eq!
(arr[ ..=
3
], [
0
,
1
,
2
,
3
]);
assert_eq!
(arr[
1
..  ], [
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
]);
assert_eq!
(arr[
1
..
