Expand description
A
TypeId
represents a globally unique identifier for a type.
Each
TypeId
is an opaque object which does not allow inspection of whatโs
inside but does allow basic operations such as cloning, comparison,
printing, and showing.
A
TypeId
is currently only available for types which ascribe to
'static
,
but this limitation may be removed in the future.
While
TypeId
implements
Hash
,
PartialOrd
, and
Ord
, it is worth
noting that the hashes and ordering will vary between Rust releases. Beware
of relying on them inside of your code!

Danger of Improper Variance
You might think that subtyping is impossible between two static types,
but this is false; there exists a static type with a static subtype.
To wit,
fn(&str)
, which is short for
for<'any> fn(&'any str)
, and
fn(&'static str)
, are two distinct, static types, and yet,
fn(&str)
is a subtype of
fn(&'static str)
, since any value of type
fn(&str)
can be used where a value of type
fn(&'static str)
is needed.
This means that abstractions around
TypeId
, despite its
'static
bound on arguments, still need to worry about unnecessary
and improper variance: it is advisable to strive for invariance
first. The usability impact will be negligible, while the reduction
in the risk of unsoundness will be most welcome.
ยง
Examples
Suppose
SubType
is a subtype of
SuperType
, that is,
a value of type
SubType
can be used wherever
a value of type
SuperType
is expected.
Suppose also that
CoVar<T>
is a generic type, which is covariant over
T
(like many other types, including
PhantomData<T>
and
Vec<T>
).
Then, by covariance,
CoVar<SubType>
is a subtype of
CoVar<SuperType>
,
that is, a value of type
CoVar<SubType>
can be used wherever
a value of type
CoVar<SuperType>
is expected.
Then if
CoVar<SuperType>
relies on
TypeId::of::<SuperType>()
to uphold any invariants,
those invariants may be broken because a value of type
CoVar<SuperType>
can be created
without going through any of its methods, like so:
type
SubType =
fn
(
&
());
type
SuperType =
fn
(
&
'static
());
type
CoVar<T> = Vec<T>;
// imagine something more complicated
let
sub: CoVar<SubType> = CoVar::new();
// we have a `CoVar<SuperType>` instance without
// *ever* having called `CoVar::<SuperType>::new()`!
let
fake_super: CoVar<SuperType> = sub;
The following is an example program that tries to use
TypeId::of
to
implement a generic type
Unique<T>
that guarantees unique instances for each
Unique<T>
,
that is, and for each type
T
there can be at most one value of type
Unique<T>
at any time.

std::any::TypeId;
use
std::collections::BTreeSet;
use
std::marker::PhantomData;
use
std::sync::Mutex;

ID_SET: Mutex<BTreeSet<TypeId>> = Mutex::new(BTreeSet::new());
// TypeId has only covariant uses, which makes Unique covariant over TypeAsId ๐จ

        }
    }
}
use

// `OtherRing` is a subtype of `TheOneRing`. Both are 'static, and thus have a TypeId.
