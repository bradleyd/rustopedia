Cast
<T>
where
    T:
SimdCast
,
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
portable_simd
#86656
)
Performs elementwise conversion of this vectorâ€™s elements to another SIMD-valid type.
This follows the semantics of Rustâ€™s
as
conversion for floats (truncating or saturating
at the limits) for each element.
Â§
Example
let
floats: Simd<f32,
4
> = Simd::from_array([
1.9
, -
4.5
, f32::INFINITY, f32::NAN]);
let
ints = floats.cast::<i32>();
assert_eq!
(ints, Simd::from_array([
1
, -
4
, i32::MAX,
0
]));
// Formally equivalent, but `Simd::cast` can optimize better.
assert_eq!
(ints, Simd::from_array(floats.to_array().map(|x| x
as
i32)));
// The float conversion does not round-trip.
let
floats_again = ints.cast();
assert_ne!
(floats, floats_again);
assert_eq!
(floats_again, Simd::from_array([
1.0
, -
4.0
,
2147483647.0
,
0.0
]));

unsafe fn
to_int_unchecked
<I>(self) -> Self::
Cast
<I>
where
    I:
SimdCast
,
    Self::
Scalar
:
FloatToInt
<I>,
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
portable_simd
#86656
)
Rounds toward zero and converts to the same-width integer type, assuming that
the value is finite and fits in that type.
Â§
Safety
The value must:
Not be NaN
Not be infinite
Be representable in the return type, after truncating off its fractional part
If these requirements are infeasible or costly, consider using the safe function
cast
,
which saturates on conversion.

Dyn Compatibility
Â§
This trait is
not
dyn compatible
.
In older versions of Rust, dyn compatibility was called "object safety", so this trait is not object safe.
