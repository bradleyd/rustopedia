Expand description
A function or function pointer.
Functions are the primary way code is executed within Rust. Function blocks, usually just
called functions, can be defined in a variety of different places and be assigned many
different attributes and modifiers.
Standalone functions that just sit within a module not attached to anything else are common,
but most functions will end up being inside
impl
blocks, either on another type itself, or
as a trait impl for that type.
fn
standalone_function() {
// code
}
pub fn
public_thing(argument: bool) -> String {
// code
}
struct
Thing {
    foo: i32,
}
impl
Thing {
pub fn
new() ->
Self
{
Self
{
            foo:
42
,
        }
    }
}
In addition to presenting fixed types in the form of
fn name(arg: type, ..) -> return_type
,
functions can also declare a list of type parameters along with trait bounds that they fall
into.
fn
generic_function<T: Clone>(x: T) -> (T, T, T) {
    (x.clone(), x.clone(), x.clone())
}
fn
generic_where<T>(x: T) -> T
where
T: std::ops::Add<Output = T> + Copy
{
    x + x + x
}
Declaring trait bounds in the angle brackets is functionally identical to using a
where
clause. It’s up to the programmer to decide which works better in each situation, but
where
tends to be better when things get longer than one line.
Along with being made public via
pub
,
fn
can also have an
extern
added for use in
FFI.
