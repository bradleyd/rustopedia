macro_rules! unreachable {
    ($($arg:tt)*) => { ... };
}
Expand description
Indicates unreachable code.
This is useful any time that the compiler can’t determine that some code is unreachable. For
example:
Match arms with guard conditions.
Loops that dynamically terminate.
Iterators that dynamically terminate.
If the determination that the code is unreachable proves incorrect, the
program immediately terminates with a
panic!
.
The unsafe counterpart of this macro is the
unreachable_unchecked
function, which
will cause undefined behavior if the code is reached.
§
Panics
This will always
panic!
because
unreachable!
is just a shorthand for
panic!
with a
fixed, specific message.
Like
panic!
, this macro has a second form for displaying custom values.
§
Examples
Match arms:
fn
foo(x:
Option
<i32>) {
match
x {
Some
(n)
if
n >=
0
=>
println!
(
"Some(Non-negative)"
),
Some
(n)
if
n <
0
=>
println!
(
"Some(Negative)"
),
Some
(
_
)           =>
unreachable!
(),
// compile error if commented out
None
=>
println!
(
"None"
)
    }
}
Iterators:
fn
divide_by_three(x: u32) -> u32 {
// one of the poorest implementations of x/3
for
i
in
0
.. {
if
3
*
i < i {
panic!
(
"u32 overflow"
); }
if
x <
3
*
i {
return
i-
1
; }
    }
unreachable!
(
"The loop should always return"
);
}
