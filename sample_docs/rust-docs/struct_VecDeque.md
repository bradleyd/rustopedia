Expand description
A double-ended queue implemented with a growable ring buffer.
The โdefaultโ usage of this type as a queue is to use
push_back
to add to
the queue, and
pop_front
to remove from the queue.
extend
and
append
push onto the back in this manner, and iterating over
VecDeque
goes front
to back.
A
VecDeque
with a known list of items can be initialized from an array:
use
std::collections::VecDeque;
let
deq = VecDeque::from([-
1
,
0
,
1
]);
Since
VecDeque
is a ring buffer, its elements are not necessarily contiguous
in memory. If you want to access the elements as a single slice, such as for
efficient sorting, you can use
make_contiguous
. It rotates the
VecDeque
so that its elements do not wrap, and returns a mutable slice to the
now-contiguous element sequence.

Rearranges the internal storage of this deque so it is one contiguous

This method does not allocate and does not change the order of the

sort a deque.

pub fn
partition_point
<P>(&self, pred: P) ->
usize
where
    P:
FnMut
(
&T
) ->
bool
,
Returns the index of the partition point according to the given predicate
(the index of the first element of the second partition).
The deque is assumed to be partitioned according to the given predicate.
This means that all elements for which the predicate returns true are at the start of the deque
and all elements for which the predicate returns false are at the end.
For example,
[7, 15, 3, 5, 4, 12, 6]
is partitioned under the predicate
x % 2 != 0
(all odd numbers are at the start, all even at the end).
If the deque is not partitioned, the returned result is unspecified and meaningless,
as this method performs a kind of binary search.

,
binary_search_by

binary_search_by_key
