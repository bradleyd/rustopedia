This is a nightly-only experimental API. (

Expand description
This is an implementation detail of
crate::ptr::write
and should
not be used anywhere else.  See its comments for why this exists.
This intrinsic can
only
be called where the pointer is a local without
projections (
write_via_move(ptr, x)
, not
write_via_move(*ptr, x)
) so
that it trivially obeys runtime-MIR rules about derefs in operands.
