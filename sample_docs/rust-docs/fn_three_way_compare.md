Expand description
Does a three-way comparison between the two integer arguments.
This is included as an intrinsic as itâ€™s useful to let it be one thing
in MIR, rather than the multiple checks and switches that make its IR
large and difficult to optimize.
The stabilized version of this intrinsic is
Ord::cmp
.
