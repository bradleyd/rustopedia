This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
layout_for_ptr
#69835
)
Expand description
Returns the size of the pointed-to value in bytes.
This is usually the same as
size_of::<T>()
. However, when
T
has
no
statically-known size, e.g., a slice
[T]
or a
trait object
,
then
size_of_val_raw
can be used to get the dynamically-known size.
Â§
Safety
This function is only safe to call if the following conditions hold:
If
T
is
Sized
, this function is always safe to call.
If the unsized tail of
T
is:
a
slice
, then the length of the slice tail must be an initialized
integer, and the size of the
entire value
(dynamic tail length + statically sized prefix) must fit in
isize
.
For the special case where the dynamic tail length is 0, this function
is safe to call.
a
trait object
, then the vtable part of the pointer must point
to a valid vtable acquired by an unsizing coercion, and the size
of the
entire value
(dynamic tail length + statically sized prefix)
must fit in
isize
.
an (unstable)
extern type
, then this function is always safe to
call, but may panic or otherwise return the wrong value, as the
extern typeâ€™s layout is not known. This is the same behavior as
size_of_val
on a reference to a type with an extern type tail.
otherwise, it is conservatively not allowed to call this function.
