#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum IntErrorKind {
    Empty,
    InvalidDigit,
    PosOverflow,
    NegOverflow,
    Zero,
}
Expand description
Enum to store the various types of errors that can cause parsing an integer to fail.
ยง
Example
if let
Err
(e) = i32::from_str_radix(
"a12"
,
10
) {
println!
(
"Failed conversion to i32: {:?}"
, e.kind());
}
Variants (Non-exhaustive)
ยง
This enum is marked as non-exhaustive
Non-exhaustive enums could have additional variants added in future. Therefore, when matching against variants of non-exhaustive enums, an extra wildcard arm must be added to account for any future variants.
ยง
1.55.0
Empty
Value being parsed is empty.
This variant will be constructed when parsing an empty string.
ยง
1.55.0
InvalidDigit
Contains an invalid digit in its context.
Among other causes, this variant will be constructed when parsing a string that
contains a non-ASCII char.
This variant is also constructed when a
+
or
-
is misplaced within a string
either on its own or in the middle of a number.
ยง
1.55.0
PosOverflow
Integer is too large to store in target integer type.
ยง
1.55.0
NegOverflow
Integer is too small to store in target integer type.
ยง
1.55.0
Zero
Value was Zero
This variant will be emitted when the parsing string has a value of zero, which
would be illegal for non-zero types.
