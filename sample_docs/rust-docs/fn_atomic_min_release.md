Expand description
Minimum with the current value using a signed comparison.
T
must be a signed integer type.
The stabilized version of this intrinsic is available on the
atomic
signed integer types via the
fetch_min
method by passing
Ordering::Release
as the
order
. For example,
AtomicI32::fetch_min
.
