pub fn sync_channel<T>(bound:
usize
) -> (
SyncSender
<T>,
Receiver
<T>)
Expand description
Creates a new synchronous, bounded channel.
All data sent on the
SyncSender
will become available on the
Receiver
in the same order as it was sent. Like asynchronous
channel
s, the
Receiver
will block until a message becomes available.
sync_channel
differs greatly in the semantics of the sender, however.
This channel has an internal buffer on which messages will be queued.
bound
specifies the buffer size. When the internal buffer becomes full,
future sends will
block
waiting for the buffer to open up. Note that a
buffer size of 0 is valid, in which case this becomes “rendezvous channel”
where each
send
will not return until a
recv
is paired with it.
The
SyncSender
can be cloned to
send
to the same channel multiple
times, but only one
Receiver
is supported.
Like asynchronous channels, if the
Receiver
is disconnected while trying
to
send
with the
SyncSender
, the
send
method will return a
SendError
. Similarly, If the
SyncSender
is disconnected while trying
to
recv
, the
recv
method will return a
RecvError
.

Examples
use
std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel;
use
std::thread;
let
(sender, receiver) = sync_channel(
1
);
// this returns immediately
sender.send(
1
).unwrap();

thread::spawn(
move
|| {
// this will block until the previous message has been received
sender.send(
2
).unwrap();
});

(receiver.recv().unwrap(),
1
);
assert_eq!
(receiver.recv().unwrap(),
