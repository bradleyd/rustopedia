Expand description
The right shift operator
>>
. Note that because this trait is implemented
for all integer types with multiple right-hand-side types, Rust’s type
checker has special handling for
_ >> _
, setting the result type for
integer operations to the type of the left-hand-side operand. This means
that though
a >> b
and
a.shr(b)
are one and the same from an evaluation
standpoint, they are different when it comes to type inference.
§
Examples
An implementation of
Shr
that lifts the
>>
operation on integers to a
wrapper around
usize
.
use
std::ops::Shr;
#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
struct
Scalar(usize);
impl
Shr<Scalar>
for
Scalar {
type
Output =
Self
;
fn
shr(
self
,
Self
(rhs):
Self
) ->
Self
::Output {
let
Self
(lhs) =
self
;
Self
(lhs >> rhs)
    }
}
assert_eq!
(Scalar(
16
) >> Scalar(
2
), Scalar(
4
));
An implementation of
Shr
that spins a vector rightward by a given amount.
use
std::ops::Shr;
#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
struct
SpinVector<T: Clone> {
    vec: Vec<T>,
}
impl
<T: Clone> Shr<usize>
for
SpinVector<T> {
type
Output =
Self
;
fn
shr(
self
, rhs: usize) ->
Self
::Output {
// Rotate the vector by `rhs` places.
let
(a, b) =
self
.vec.split_at(
self
.vec.len() - rhs);
let
mut
spun_vector =
vec!
[];
        spun_vector.extend_from_slice(b);
        spun_vector.extend_from_slice(a);
Self
{ vec: spun_vector }
    }
}
assert_eq!
(SpinVector { vec:
vec!
[
0
,
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
] } >>
2
,
           SpinVector { vec:
vec!
[

,

] });
