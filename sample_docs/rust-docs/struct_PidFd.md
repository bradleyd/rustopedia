pub struct PidFd {

This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
linux_pidfd
#82971
)
Available on
Linux
only.
Expand description
This type represents a file descriptor that refers to a process.
A
PidFd
can be obtained by setting the corresponding option on
Command
with
create_pidfd
. Subsequently, the created pidfd can be retrieved
from the
Child
by calling
pidfd
or
into_pidfd
.
Example:
#![feature(linux_pidfd)]
use
std::os::linux::process::{CommandExt, ChildExt};
use
std::process::Command;
let
mut
child = Command::new(
"echo"
)
    .create_pidfd(
true
)
    .spawn()
    .expect(
"Failed to spawn child"
);
let
pidfd = child
    .into_pidfd()
    .expect(
"Failed to retrieve pidfd"
);
// The file descriptor will be closed when `pidfd` is dropped.
Refer to the man page of
pidfd_open(2)
for further details.

impl
PidFd
Source
pub fn
kill
(&self) ->
Result
<
()
>
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
linux_pidfd
#82971
)
Forces the child process to exit.
Unlike
Child::kill
it is possible to attempt to kill
reaped children since PidFd does not suffer from pid recycling
races. But doing so will return an Error.
Source
pub fn
wait
(&self) ->
Result
<
ExitStatus
>
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
linux_pidfd
#82971
)
Waits for the child to exit completely, returning the status that it exited with.
Unlike
Child::wait
it does not ensure that the stdin handle is closed.
Additionally it will not return an
ExitStatus
if the child
has already been reaped. Instead an error will be returned.
Source
pub fn
try_wait
(&self) ->
Result
<
Option
<
ExitStatus
>>
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
linux_pidfd
#82971
)
Attempts to collect the exit status of the child if it has already exited.
Unlike
Child::try_wait
this method will return an Error
if the child has already been reaped.
