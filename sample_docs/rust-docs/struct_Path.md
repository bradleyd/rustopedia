pub struct Path {
/* private fields */
}
Expand description
A slice of a path (akin to
str
).
This type supports a number of operations for inspecting a path, including
breaking the path into its components (separated by
/
on Unix and by either
/
or
\
on Windows), extracting the file name, determining whether the path
is absolute, and so on.
This is an
unsized
type, meaning that it must always be used behind a
pointer like
&
or
Box
. For an owned version of this type,
see
PathBuf
.
More details about the overall approach can be found in
the
module documentation
.
Â§
Examples
use
std::path::Path;
use
std::ffi::OsStr;
// Note: this example does work on Windows
let
path = Path::new(
"./foo/bar.txt"
);
let
parent = path.parent();
assert_eq!
(parent,
Some
(Path::new(
"./foo"
)));
let
file_stem = path.file_stem();
assert_eq!
(file_stem,
Some
(OsStr::new(
"bar"
)));
let
extension = path.extension();
assert_eq!
(extension,
Some
(OsStr::new(
"txt"
)));

pub fn

Sized
>(s:

Path
Directly wraps a string slice as a
Path
slice.
This is a cost-free conversion.
Â§
Examples
use
std::path::Path;

Path::new(
"foo.txt"
);
You can create
Path
s from
String
s, or even other
Path
s:
use
std::path::Path;
let
string = String::from(
"foo.txt"
);
let
from_string = Path::new(
&
string);
let
from_path = Path::new(
&
from_string);
assert_eq!
(from_string, from_path);

Yields the underlying
OsStr

"foo.txt"
).as_os_str();
assert_eq!

pub fn
as_mut_os_str
(&mut self) -> &mut
OsStr
Yields a mutable reference to the underlying
OsStr
slice.
Â§
Examples
use
std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
let
mut
path = PathBuf::from(
"Foo.TXT"
);
assert_ne!
(path, Path::new(
"foo.txt"

path.as_mut_os_str().make_ascii_lowercase();

"foo.txt"

pub fn
to_str
(&self) ->
Option
<&
str
>
Yields a
&str
slice if the
Path
is valid unicode.
This conversion may entail doing a check for UTF-8 validity.
Note that validation is performed because non-UTF-8 strings are
perfectly valid for some OS.
Â§
Examples
use
std::path::Path;
let
path = Path::new(
"foo.txt"
);
assert_eq!
(path.to_str(),
Some
(
"foo.txt"
));

pub fn
to_string_lossy
(&self) ->
Cow
<'_,
str
>
Converts a
Path
to a
Cow<str>
.
Any non-UTF-8 sequences are replaced with
U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER
.
Â§
Examples
Calling
to_string_lossy
on a
Path
with valid unicode:
use
std::path::Path;
let
path = Path::new(
"foo.txt"
);
assert_eq!
(path.to_string_lossy(),
"foo.txt"
);
Had
path
contained invalid unicode, the
to_string_lossy
call might
have returned
"foï¿½.txt"
.

pub fn
to_path_buf
(&self) ->

Converts a

assert_eq!

pub fn
is_absolute
(&self) ->
bool
Returns
true
if the
Path
is absolute, i.e., if it is independent of
the current directory.
On Unix, a path is absolute if it starts with the root, so
is_absolute
and
has_root
are equivalent.
On Windows, a path is absolute if it has a prefix and starts with the
root:
c:\windows
is absolute, while
c:temp
and
\temp
are not.

Examples
use
std::path::Path;
assert!
(!Path::new(
"foo.txt"
).is_absolute());

pub fn
is_relative
(&self) ->

Returns
true
if the
Path

See
is_absolute

assert!

"foo.txt"
).is_relative());

Â·
Source
pub fn
has_root
(&self) ->
bool
Returns
true
if the
Path
has a root.
On Unix, a path has a root if it begins with
/
.
On Windows, a path has a root if it:
has no prefix and begins with a separator, e.g.,
\windows
has a prefix followed by a separator, e.g.,
c:\windows
but not
c:windows
has any non-disk prefix, e.g.,
\\server\share

Examples
use

(Path::new(
"/etc/passwd"
).has_root());
1.0.0

pub fn
parent
(&self) ->
Option
<&
Path
>
Returns the
Path
without its final component, if there is one.
This means it returns
Some("")
for relative paths with one component.
Returns
None
if the path terminates in a root or prefix, or if itâ€™s
the empty string.

pub fn

(&self) ->
Ancestors
<'_>
â“˜
Produces an iterator over
Path
and its ancestors.
The iterator will yield the
Path
that is returned if the
parent
method is used zero
or more times. If the
parent
method returns
None
, the iterator will do likewise.
The iterator will always yield at least one value, namely
Some(&self)
. Next it will yield
&self.parent()
,
&self.parent().and_then(Path::parent)
and so on.

pub fn
components
(&self) ->
Components
<'_>
â“˜
Produces an iterator over the
Component
s of the path.
When parsing the path, there is a small amount of normalization:
Repeated separators are ignored, so
a/b
and
a//b
both have
a
and
b
as components.
Occurrences of
.
are normalized away, except if they are at the
beginning of the path. For example,
a/./b
,
a/b/
,
a/b/.
and
a/b
all have
a
and
b
as components, but
./a/b
starts with
an additional
CurDir
component.
A trailing slash is normalized away,
/a/b
and
/a/b/
are equivalent.
Note that no other normalization takes place; in particular,
a/c
and
a/b/../c
are distinct, to account for the possibility that
b
is a symbolic link (so its parent isnâ€™t
a
).

Result
<
ReadDir
>
Returns an iterator over the entries within a directory.
The iterator will yield instances of
io::Result
<
fs::DirEntry
>
. New
errors may be encountered after an iterator is initially constructed.
This is an alias to
fs::read_dir
.

Examples
use
std::path::Path;
let
path = Path::new(
"/laputa"
);
for
entry
in
path.read_dir().expect(
"read_dir call failed"
) {

println!

"{:?}"

pub fn
exists
(&self) ->
bool
Returns
true
if the path points at an existing entity.
Warning: this method may be error-prone, consider using
try_exists()
instead!
It also has a risk of introducing time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) bugs.
This function will traverse symbolic links to query information about the
destination file.
If you cannot access the metadata of the file, e.g. because of a
permission error or broken symbolic links, this will return
false
.
Â§
Examples
use
std::path::Path;
assert!
(!Path::new(
"does_not_exist.txt"
).exists());

This is a convenience function that coerces errors to false. If you want to
check errors, call
Path::try_exists

pub fn
try_exists
(&self) ->
Result
<
bool
>
Returns
Ok(true)
if the path points at an existing entity.
This function will traverse symbolic links to query information about the
destination file. In case of broken symbolic links this will return
Ok(false)
.
Path::exists()
only checks whether or not a path was both found and readable. By
contrast,
try_exists
will return
Ok(true)
or
Ok(false)
, respectively, if the path
was
verified
to exist or not exist. If its existence can neither be confirmed nor
denied, it will propagate an
Err(_)
instead. This can be the case if e.g. listing
permission is denied on one of the parent directories.
Note that while this avoids some pitfalls of the
exists()
method, it still can not
prevent time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) bugs. You should only use it in scenarios
where those bugs are not an issue.
This is an alias for
std::fs::exists
.
Â§
Examples
use
std::path::Path;
assert!
(!Path::new(
"does_not_exist.txt"
).try_exists().expect(
"Can't check existence of file does_not_exist.txt"
));

"/root/secret_file.txt"

pub fn
is_file
(&self) ->
bool
Returns
true
if the path exists on disk and is pointing at a regular file.
This function will traverse symbolic links to query information about the
destination file.
If you cannot access the metadata of the file, e.g. because of a
permission error or broken symbolic links, this will return
false
.
Â§
Examples
use
std::path::Path;
assert_eq!
(Path::new(
"./is_a_directory/"
).is_file(),
false
);
assert_eq!
(Path::new(
"a_file.txt"

This is a convenience function that coerces errors to false. If you want to
check errors, call
fs::metadata
and handle its
Result
. Then call
fs::Metadata::is_file
if it was
Ok
.
When the goal is simply to read from (or write to) the source, the most
reliable way to test the source can be read (or written to) is to open
it. Only using
is_file
can break workflows like
diff <( prog_a )
on
a Unix-like system for example. See
fs::File::open
or
fs::OpenOptions::open
for more information.
