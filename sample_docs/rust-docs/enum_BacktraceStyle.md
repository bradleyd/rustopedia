Enum
BacktraceStyle
Copy item path

#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum BacktraceStyle {
    Short,
    Full,
    Off,
}
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
panic_backtrace_config
#93346
)
Expand description
The configuration for whether and how the default panic hook will capture
and display the backtrace.
Variants (Non-exhaustive)
ยง
This enum is marked as non-exhaustive
Non-exhaustive enums could have additional variants added in future. Therefore, when matching against variants of non-exhaustive enums, an extra wildcard arm must be added to account for any future variants.
ยง
Short
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
panic_backtrace_config
#93346
)
Prints a terser backtrace which ideally only contains relevant
information.
ยง
Full
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
panic_backtrace_config
#93346
)
Prints a backtrace with all possible information.
ยง
Off
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
panic_backtrace_config
#93346
)
Disable collecting and displaying backtraces.
