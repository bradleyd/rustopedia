Expand description
The version of the call operator that takes a by-value receiver.
Instances of
FnOnce
can be called, but might not be callable multiple
times. Because of this, if the only thing known about a type is that it
implements
FnOnce
, it can only be called once.
FnOnce
is implemented automatically by closures that might consume captured
variables, as well as all types that implement
FnMut
, e.g., (safe)
function pointers
(since
FnOnce
is a supertrait of
FnMut
).
Since both
Fn
and
FnMut
are subtraits of
FnOnce
, any instance of
Fn
or
FnMut
can be used where a
FnOnce
is expected.
Use
FnOnce
as a bound when you want to accept a parameter of function-like
type and only need to call it once. If you need to call the parameter
repeatedly, use
FnMut
as a bound; if you also need it to not mutate
state, use
Fn
.
See the
chapter on closures in
The Rust Programming Language
for
some more information on this topic.
Also of note is the special syntax for
Fn
traits (e.g.
Fn(usize, bool) -> usize
). Those interested in the technical details of
this can refer to
the relevant section in the
Rustonomicon
.

Examples
ยง
Using a
FnOnce
parameter
fn
consume_with_relish<F>(func: F)
where
F: FnOnce() -> String
{
// `func` consumes its captured variables, so it cannot be run more
    // than once.
println!
(
"Consumed: {}"
, func());
println!
(
"Delicious!"
);
// Attempting to invoke `func()` again will throw a `use of moved
    // value` error for `func`.
}
let
x = String::from(
"x"
);
let
consume_and_return_x =
move
|| x;
consume_with_relish(consume_and_return_x);
// `consume_and_return_x` can no longer be invoked at this point
