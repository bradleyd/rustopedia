Expand description
Borrowed reference to an OS string (see
OsString
).
This type represents a borrowed reference to a string in the operating system‚Äôs preferred
representation.
&OsStr
is to
OsString
as
&
str
is to
String
: the
former in each pair are borrowed references; the latter are owned strings.
See the
module‚Äôs toplevel documentation about conversions
for a discussion on
the traits which
OsStr
implements for
conversions
from/to native representations.

pub unsafe fn
from_encoded_bytes_unchecked
(bytes: &[
u8
]) -> &Self
Converts a slice of bytes to an OS string slice without checking that the string contains
valid
OsStr
-encoded data.
The byte encoding is an unspecified, platform-specific, self-synchronizing superset of UTF-8.
By being a self-synchronizing superset of UTF-8, this encoding is also a superset of 7-bit
ASCII.
See the
module‚Äôs toplevel documentation about conversions
for safe,
cross-platform
conversions
from/to native representations.
¬ß
Safety
As the encoding is unspecified, callers must pass in bytes that originated as a mixture of
validated UTF-8 and bytes from
OsStr::as_encoded_bytes
from within the same Rust version
built for the same target platform.  For example, reconstructing an
OsStr
from bytes sent
over the network or stored in a file will likely violate these safety rules.
Due to the encoding being self-synchronizing, the bytes from
OsStr::as_encoded_bytes
can be
split either immediately before or immediately after any valid non-empty UTF-8 substring.
¬ß
Example
use
std::ffi::OsStr;
let
os_str = OsStr::new(
"Mary had a little lamb"
);
let
bytes = os_str.as_encoded_bytes();
let
words = bytes.split(|b|
*
b ==
b' '
);
let
words: Vec<
&
OsStr> = words.map(|word| {
// SAFETY:
    // - Each `word` only contains content that originated from `OsStr::as_encoded_bytes`
    // - Only split with ASCII whitespace which is a non-empty UTF-8 substring
unsafe
{ OsStr::from_encoded_bytes_unchecked(word) }
}).collect();

Returns the length of this

Note that this does

return the number of bytes in the string in
OS string form.
The length returned is that of the underlying storage used by
OsStr
.
As discussed in the
OsString
introduction,
OsString
and
OsStr
store strings in a form best suited for cheap inter-conversion between
native-platform and Rust string forms, which may differ significantly
from both of them, including in storage size and encoding.
This number is simply useful for passing to other methods, like
OsString::with_capacity
to avoid reallocations.

pub fn
as_encoded_bytes
(&self) -> &[
u8
]
‚ìò
Converts an OS string slice to a byte slice.  To convert the byte slice back into an OS
string slice, use the
OsStr::from_encoded_bytes_unchecked
function.
The byte encoding is an unspecified, platform-specific, self-synchronizing superset of UTF-8.
By being a self-synchronizing superset of UTF-8, this encoding is also a superset of 7-bit
ASCII.
Note: As the encoding is unspecified, any sub-slice of bytes that is not valid UTF-8 should
be treated as opaque and only comparable within the same Rust version built for the same
target platform.  For example, sending the slice over the network or storing it in a file
will likely result in incompatible byte slices.  See
OsString
for more encoding details
and
std::ffi
for platform-specific, specified conversions.

Takes a substring based on a range that corresponds to the return value of
OsStr::as_encoded_bytes

The range‚Äôs start and end must lie on valid

boundaries.
A valid
OsStr

The start of the string
The end of the string
Immediately before a valid non-empty UTF-8 substring
Immediately after a valid non-empty UTF-8 substring

Panics if

does not lie on valid
