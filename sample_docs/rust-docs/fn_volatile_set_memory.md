ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
core_intrinsics
)
Expand description
Equivalent to the appropriate
llvm.memset.p0i8.*
intrinsic, with a
size of
count * size_of::<T>()
and an alignment of
min_align_of::<T>()
.
This intrinsic does not have a stable counterpart.
Â§
Safety
The safety requirements are consistent with
write_bytes
while the write behavior is volatile,
which means it will not be optimized out unless
_count
or
size_of::<T>()
is equal to zero.
