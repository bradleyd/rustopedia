pub struct Thread {
/* private fields */
}
Expand description
A handle to a thread.
Threads are represented via the
Thread
type, which you can get in one of
two ways:
By spawning a new thread, e.g., using the
thread::spawn
function, and calling
thread
on the
JoinHandle
.
By requesting the current thread, using the
thread::current
function.
The
thread::current
function is available even for threads not spawned
by the APIs of this module.
There is usually no need to create a
Thread
struct yourself, one
should instead use a function like
spawn
to create new threads, see the
docs of
Builder
and
spawn
for more details.

pub fn
unpark
(&self)
Atomically makes the handleâ€™s token available if it is not already.
Every thread is equipped with some basic low-level blocking support, via
the
park
function and the
unpark()
method. These can be
used as a more CPU-efficient implementation of a spinlock.
See the
park documentation
for more details.
Â§
Examples
use
std::thread;
use
std::time::Duration;
let
parked_thread = thread::Builder::new()
    .spawn(|| {
println!
(
"Parking thread"
);
        thread::park();
println!
(
"Thread unparked"
);
    })
    .unwrap();
// Let some time pass for the thread to be spawned.
thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(
10
));
println!
(
"Unpark the thread"
);
parked_thread.thread().unpark();

parked_thread.join().unwrap();

pub fn
id
(&self) ->
ThreadId
Gets the threadâ€™s unique identifier.
Â§
Examples
use
std::thread;
let
other_thread = thread::spawn(|| {
    thread::current().id()
});
let
other_thread_id = other_thread.join().unwrap();
assert!
(thread::current().id() != other_thread_id);

pub fn
name
(&self) ->
Option
<&
str
>
Gets the threadâ€™s name.
For more information about named threads, see
this module-level documentation
.
Â§
Examples
Threads by default have no name specified:
use
std::thread;
let
builder = thread::Builder::new();
let
handler = builder.spawn(|| {
assert!
(thread::current().name().is_none());
}).unwrap();

handler.join().unwrap();
Thread with a specified name:
use
std::thread;
let
builder = thread::Builder::new()
    .name(
"foo"
.into());
let
handler = builder.spawn(|| {
assert_eq!
(thread::current().name(),
Some
(
"foo"
))
}).unwrap();

handler.join().unwrap();

pub fn
into_raw
(self) ->
*const
()
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
thread_raw
#97523
)
Consumes the
Thread
, returning a raw pointer.
To avoid a memory leak the pointer must be converted
back into a
Thread
using
Thread::from_raw
.
Â§
Examples
#![feature(thread_raw)]
use
std::thread::{
self
, Thread};
let
thread = thread::current();
let
id = thread.id();
let
ptr = Thread::into_raw(thread);
unsafe
{
assert_eq!
(Thread::from_raw(ptr).id(), id);
}
Source
pub unsafe fn
from_raw
(ptr:
*const
()
) ->
Thread
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
thread_raw
#97523
)
Constructs a
Thread
from a raw pointer.
The raw pointer must have been previously returned
by a call to
Thread::into_raw
.
Â§
Safety
This function is unsafe because improper use may lead
to memory unsafety, even if the returned
Thread
is never
accessed.
Creating a
Thread
from a pointer other than one returned
from
Thread::into_raw
is
undefined behavior
.
Calling this function twice on the same raw pointer can lead
to a double-free if both
Thread
instances are dropped.
