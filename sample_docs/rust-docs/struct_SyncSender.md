Expand description
The sending-half of Rustโs synchronous
sync_channel
type.
Messages can be sent through this channel with
send
or
try_send
.
send
will block if there is no space in the internal buffer.
ยง
Examples
use
std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel;
use
std::thread;
// Create a sync_channel with buffer size 2
let
(sync_sender, receiver) = sync_channel(
2
);
let
sync_sender2 = sync_sender.clone();
// First thread owns sync_sender
thread::spawn(
move
|| {
    sync_sender.send(
1
).unwrap();
    sync_sender.send(
2
).unwrap();
});
// Second thread owns sync_sender2
thread::spawn(
move
|| {
    sync_sender2.send(
3
).unwrap();
// thread will now block since the buffer is full
println!
(
"Thread unblocked!"
);
});
let
mut
msg;

msg = receiver.recv().unwrap();
println!
(
"message {msg} received"
);
// "Thread unblocked!" will be printed now
msg = receiver.recv().unwrap();
println!
(
"message {msg} received"
);

msg = receiver.recv().unwrap();
println!
(
"message {msg} received"
);

pub fn
send
(&self, t: T) ->
Result
<
()
,
SendError
<T>>
Sends a value on this synchronous channel.
This function will
block
until space in the internal buffer becomes
available or a receiver is available to hand off the message to.
Note that a successful send does
not
guarantee that the receiver will
ever see the data if there is a buffer on this channel. Items may be
enqueued in the internal buffer for the receiver to receive at a later
time. If the buffer size is 0, however, the channel becomes a rendezvous
channel and it guarantees that the receiver has indeed received
the data if this function returns success.
This function will never panic, but it may return
Err
if the
Receiver
has disconnected and is no longer able to receive
information.

Examples
use
std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel;
use
std::thread;
// Create a rendezvous sync_channel with buffer size 0
let
(sync_sender, receiver) = sync_channel(
0
);

thread::spawn(
move
|| {
println!
(
"sending message..."
);
   sync_sender.send(
1
).unwrap();
// Thread is now blocked until the message is received
println!
(
"...message received!"
);
});

pub fn
try_send
(&self, t: T) ->
Result
<
()
,
TrySendError
<T>>
Attempts to send a value on this channel without blocking.
This method differs from
send
by returning immediately if the
channelโs buffer is full or no receiver is waiting to acquire some
data. Compared with
send
, this function has two failure cases
instead of one (one for disconnection, one for a full buffer).
See
send
for notes about guarantees of whether the
receiver has received the data or not if this function is successful.

Examples
use
std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel;
use
std::thread;
// Create a sync_channel with buffer size 1
let
(sync_sender, receiver) = sync_channel(

let
sync_sender2 = sync_sender.clone();
// First thread owns sync_sender
thread::spawn(
move
|| {
    sync_sender.send(
1
).unwrap();
    sync_sender.send(
2
).unwrap();
// Thread blocked
});
// Second thread owns sync_sender2
thread::spawn(
move
|| {
// This will return an error and send
    // no message if the buffer is full
let _
= sync_sender2.try_send(
3
