pub struct Receiver<T> {

Expand description
The receiving half of Rustโs
channel
(or
sync_channel
) type.
This half can only be owned by one thread.
Messages sent to the channel can be retrieved using
recv
.
ยง
Examples
use
std::sync::mpsc::channel;
use
std::thread;
use
std::time::Duration;
let
(send, recv) = channel();

thread::spawn(
move
|| {
    send.send(
"Hello world!"
).unwrap();
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(
2
));
// block for two seconds
send.send(
"Delayed for 2 seconds"
).unwrap();
});
println!
(
"{}"
, recv.recv().unwrap());
// Received immediately
println!
(
"Waiting..."
);
println!
(
"{}"
, recv.recv().unwrap());
// Received after 2 seconds

pub fn
try_recv
(&self) ->
Result
<T,
TryRecvError
>
Attempts to return a pending value on this receiver without blocking.
This method will never block the caller in order to wait for data to
become available. Instead, this will always return immediately with a
possible option of pending data on the channel.
This is useful for a flavor of โoptimistic checkโ before deciding to
block on a receiver.
Compared with
recv
, this function has two failure cases instead of one
(one for disconnection, one for an empty buffer).

Examples
use
std::sync::mpsc::{Receiver, channel};
let
(
_
, receiver): (

, Receiver<i32>) = channel();

pub fn
recv
(&self) ->
Result
<T,
RecvError
>
Attempts to wait for a value on this receiver, returning an error if the
corresponding channel has hung up.
This function will always block the current thread if there is no data
available and itโs possible for more data to be sent (at least one sender
still exists). Once a message is sent to the corresponding
Sender
(or
SyncSender
), this receiver will wake up and return that
message.
If the corresponding
Sender
has disconnected, or it disconnects while
this call is blocking, this call will wake up and return
Err
to
indicate that no more messages can ever be received on this channel.
However, since channels are buffered, messages sent before the disconnect
will still be properly received.
ยง
Examples
use
std::sync::mpsc;
use
std::thread;
let
(send, recv) = mpsc::channel();
let
handle = thread::spawn(
move
|| {
    send.send(
1u8
).unwrap();
});

handle.join().unwrap();
assert_eq!
(
Ok
(
1
), recv.recv());
Buffering behavior:
use
std::sync::mpsc;
use
std::thread;
use
std::sync::mpsc::RecvError;
let
(send, recv) = mpsc::channel();
let
handle = thread::spawn(
move
|| {
    send.send(
1u8
).unwrap();
    send.send(
2
).unwrap();
    send.send(
3
).unwrap();
    drop(send);
});
// wait for the thread to join so we ensure the sender is dropped
handle.join().unwrap();

pub fn
recv_timeout
(&self, timeout:
Duration
) ->
Result
<T,
RecvTimeoutError
>
Attempts to wait for a value on this receiver, returning an error if the
corresponding channel has hung up, or if it waits more than
timeout
.
This function will always block the current thread if there is no data
available and itโs possible for more data to be sent (at least one sender
still exists). Once a message is sent to the corresponding
Sender
(or
SyncSender
), this receiver will wake up and return that
message.
If the corresponding
Sender
has disconnected, or it disconnects while
this call is blocking, this call will wake up and return
Err
to
indicate that no more messages can ever be received on this channel.
However, since channels are buffered, messages sent before the disconnect
will still be properly received.

Examples
Successfully receiving value before encountering timeout:

This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
deadline_api
#46316
)
Attempts to wait for a value on this receiver, returning an error if the
corresponding channel has hung up, or if
deadline
is reached.
This function will always block the current thread if there is no data
available and itโs possible for more data to be sent. Once a message is
sent to the corresponding
Sender
(or
SyncSender
), then this
receiver will wake up and return that message.
If the corresponding
Sender
has disconnected, or it disconnects while
this call is blocking, this call will wake up and return
Err
to
indicate that no more messages can ever be received on this channel.
However, since channels are buffered, messages sent before the disconnect
will still be properly received.
