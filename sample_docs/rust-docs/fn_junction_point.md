Expand description
Creates a junction point.
The
link
path will be a directory junction pointing to the original path.
If
link
is a relative path then it will be made absolute prior to creating the junction point.
The
original
path must be a directory or a link to a directory, otherwise the junction point will be broken.
If either path is not a local file path then this will fail.
