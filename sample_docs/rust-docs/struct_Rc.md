Expand description
A single-threaded reference-counting pointer. â€˜Rcâ€™ stands for â€˜Reference
Countedâ€™.
See the
module-level documentation
for more details.
The inherent methods of
Rc
are all associated functions, which means
that you have to call them as e.g.,
Rc::get_mut(&mut value)
instead of
value.get_mut()
. This avoids conflicts with methods of the inner type
T
.

pub fn
new_cyclic
<F>(data_fn: F) ->
Rc
<T>
where
    F:
FnOnce
(&
Weak
<T>) -> T,
Constructs a new
Rc<T>
while giving you a
Weak<T>
to the allocation,
to allow you to construct a
T
which holds a weak pointer to itself.
Generally, a structure circularly referencing itself, either directly or
indirectly, should not hold a strong reference to itself to prevent a memory leak.
Using this function, you get access to the weak pointer during the
initialization of
T
, before the
Rc<T>
is created, such that you can
clone and store it inside the
T
.
new_cyclic
first allocates the managed allocation for the
Rc<T>
,
then calls your closure, giving it a
Weak<T>
to this allocation,
and only afterwards completes the construction of the
Rc<T>
by placing
the
T
returned from your closure into the allocation.
Since the new
Rc<T>
is not fully-constructed until
Rc<T>::new_cyclic
returns, calling
upgrade
on the weak reference inside your closure will
fail and result in a
None
value.
Â§
Panics
If
data_fn
panics, the panic is propagated to the caller, and the
temporary
Weak<T>
is dropped normally.
Â§
Examples
use
std::rc::{Rc, Weak};
struct
Gadget {
    me: Weak<Gadget>,
}
impl
Gadget {
/// Constructs a reference counted Gadget.
fn
new() -> Rc<
Self

// `me` is a `Weak<Gadget>` pointing at the new allocation of the
        // `Rc` we're constructing.
Rc::new_cyclic(|me| {
// Create the actual struct here.

/// Returns a reference counted pointer to Self.

pub unsafe fn
from_raw
(ptr:
*const T
) ->
Rc
<T>
Constructs an
Rc<T>
from a raw pointer.
The raw pointer must have been previously returned by a call to
Rc<U>::into_raw
with the following requirements:
If
U
is sized, it must have the same size and alignment as
T
. This
is trivially true if
U
is
T
.
If
U
is unsized, its data pointer must have the same size and
alignment as
T
. This is trivially true if
Rc<U>
was constructed
through
Rc<T>
and then converted to
Rc<U>
through an
unsized
coercion
.
Note that if
U
or
U
â€™s data pointer is not
T
but has the same size
and alignment, this is basically like transmuting references of
different types. See
mem::transmute
for more information
on what restrictions apply in this case.
The raw pointer must point to a block of memory allocated by the global allocator
The user of
from_raw
has to make sure a specific value of
T
is only
dropped once.
This function is unsafe because improper use may lead to memory unsafety,
even if the returned
Rc<T>
is never accessed.
Â§
Examples
use
std::rc::Rc;
let
x = Rc::new(
"hello"
.to_owned());
let
x_ptr = Rc::into_raw(x);
unsafe
{
// Convert back to an `Rc` to prevent leak.
let
x = Rc::from_raw(x_ptr);
assert_eq!

x,
"hello"

// Further calls to `Rc::from_raw(x_ptr)` would be memory-unsafe.

(ptr:
*const T

<T, A>
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
allocator_api
#32838
)
Constructs an
Rc<T, A>
from a raw pointer in the provided allocator.
The raw pointer must have been previously returned by a call to
Rc<U, A>::into_raw
with the following requirements:
If
U
is sized, it must have the same size and alignment as
T
. This
is trivially true if
U
is
T
.
If
U
is unsized, its data pointer must have the same size and
alignment as
T
. This is trivially true if
Rc<U>
was constructed
through
Rc<T>
and then converted to
Rc<U>
through an
unsized
coercion
.
Note that if
U
or
U
â€™s data pointer is not
T
but has the same size
and alignment, this is basically like transmuting references of
different types. See
mem::transmute
for more information
on what restrictions apply in this case.
The raw pointer must point to a block of memory allocated by
alloc
The user of
from_raw
has to make sure a specific value of
T
is only
dropped once.
This function is unsafe because improper use may lead to memory unsafety,
even if the returned
Rc<T>
is never accessed.

count reaches zero then the only other references (if any) are
Weak

where

Takes each element in the

Â§
Performance characteristics
Â§
The general case
In the general case, collecting into
Rc<[T]>
is done by first
collecting into a
Vec<T>
. That is, when writing the following:
let
evens: Rc<[u8]> = (
0
..
10
).filter(|
&
x| x %
2
==
0
).collect();
this behaves as if we wrote:
let
evens: Rc<[u8]> = (
0
..
10
).filter(|
&
x| x %
2
==
0
)
    .collect::<Vec<
_
>>()
// The first set of allocations happens here.
.into();
// A second allocation for `Rc<[T]>` happens here.
This will allocate as many times as needed for constructing the
Vec<T>
and then it will allocate once for turning the
Vec<T>
into the
Rc<[T]>
.
Â§
Iterators of known length
When your
Iterator
implements
TrustedLen
and is of an exact size,
a single allocation will be made for the
Rc<[T]>
. For example:
let
evens: Rc<[u8]> = (
0
..
10
).collect();
// Just a single allocation happens here.
