Source
pub struct Alignment(
/* private fields */
);
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
ptr_alignment_type
#102070
)
Expand description
A type storing a
usize
which is a power of two, and thus
represents a possible alignment in the Rust abstract machine.
Note that particularly large alignments, while representable in this type,
are likely not to be supported by actual allocators and linkers.
Implementations
ยง
Source
ยง
impl
Alignment
Source
pub const
MIN
:
Alignment
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
ptr_alignment_type
#102070
)
The smallest possible alignment, 1.
All addresses are always aligned at least this much.
ยง
Examples
#![feature(ptr_alignment_type)]
use
std::ptr::Alignment;
assert_eq!
(Alignment::MIN.as_usize(),
1
);
Source
pub const fn
of
<T>() ->
Alignment
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
ptr_alignment_type
#102070
)
Returns the alignment for a type.
This provides the same numerical value as
align_of
,
but in an
Alignment
instead of a
usize
.
Source
pub const fn
new
(align:
usize
) ->
Option
<
Alignment
>
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
ptr_alignment_type
#102070
)
Creates an
Alignment
from a
usize
, or returns
None
if itโs
not a power of two.
Note that
0
is not a power of two, nor a valid alignment.
Source
pub const unsafe fn
new_unchecked
(align:
usize
) ->
Alignment
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
ptr_alignment_type
#102070
)
Creates an
Alignment
from a power-of-two
usize
.
ยง
Safety
align
must be a power of two.
Equivalently, it must be
1 << exp
for some
exp
in
0..usize::BITS
.
It must
not
be zero.
Source
pub const fn
as_usize
(self) ->
usize
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
ptr_alignment_type
#102070
)
Returns the alignment as a
usize
.
Source
pub const fn
as_nonzero
(self) ->
NonZero
<
usize
>
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
ptr_alignment_type
#102070
)
Returns the alignment as a
NonZero
<
usize
>
.
Source
pub const fn
log2
(self) ->
u32
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
ptr_alignment_type
#102070
)
Returns the base-2 logarithm of the alignment.
This is always exact, as
self
represents a power of two.
ยง
Examples
#![feature(ptr_alignment_type)]
use
std::ptr::Alignment;
assert_eq!
(Alignment::of::<u8>().log2(),
0
);
assert_eq!
(Alignment::new(
1024
).unwrap().log2(),
10
);
Source
pub const fn
mask
(self) ->
usize
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
ptr_alignment_type
#102070
)
Returns a bit mask that can be used to match this alignment.
This is equivalent to
!(self.as_usize() - 1)
.
ยง
Examples
#![feature(ptr_alignment_type)]
#![feature(ptr_mask)]
use
std::ptr::{Alignment, NonNull};
#[repr(align(
1
))]
struct
Align1(u8);
#[repr(align(
2
))]
struct
Align2(u16);
#[repr(align(
4
))]
struct
Align4(u32);
let
one = <NonNull<Align1>>::dangling().as_ptr();
let
two = <NonNull<Align2>>::dangling().as_ptr();
let
four = <NonNull<Align4>>::dangling().as_ptr();
assert_eq!
(four.mask(Alignment::of::<Align1>().mask()), four);
assert_eq!
(four.mask(Alignment::of::<Align2>().mask()), four);
assert_eq!
(four.mask(Alignment::of::<Align4>().mask()), four);
assert_ne!
(one.mask(Alignment::of::<Align4>().mask()), one);
