This is a nightly-only experimental API. (

)
Expand description
Used to specify which residuals can be converted into which
crate::ops::Try
types.
Every
Try
type needs to be recreatable from its own associated
Residual
type, but can also have additional
FromResidual
implementations
to support interconversion with other
Try
types.
Required Methods
ยง
Source
fn
from_residual
(residual: R) -> Self
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
try_trait_v2
#84277
)
Constructs the type from a compatible
Residual
type.
This should be implemented consistently with the
branch
method such
that applying the
?
operator will get back an equivalent residual:
FromResidual::from_residual(r).branch() --> ControlFlow::Break(r)
.
(The residual is not mandated to be
identical
when interconversion is involved.)

Examples
#![feature(try_trait_v2)]
use
std::ops::{ControlFlow, FromResidual};
assert_eq!
(
Result
::<String, i64>::from_residual(
Err
(
3_u8
)),
Err
(
3
));
assert_eq!
(
Option
::<String>::from_residual(
None
),
None
);
assert_eq!
(
    ControlFlow::<
_
, String>::from_residual(ControlFlow::Break(
5
)),
    ControlFlow::Break(
5
),
);
Dyn Compatibility
ยง
This trait is
not
dyn compatible
.
In older versions of Rust, dyn compatibility was called "object safety", so this trait is not object safe.
