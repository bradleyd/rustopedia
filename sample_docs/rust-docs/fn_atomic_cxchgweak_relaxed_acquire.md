Expand description
Stores a value if the current value is the same as the
old
value.
T
must be an integer or pointer type.
The stabilized version of this intrinsic is available on the
atomic
types via the
compare_exchange_weak
method by passing
Ordering::Relaxed
and
Ordering::Acquire
as the success and failure parameters.
For example,
AtomicBool::compare_exchange_weak
.
