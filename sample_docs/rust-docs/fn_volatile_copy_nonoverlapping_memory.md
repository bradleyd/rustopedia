This is a nightly-only experimental API. (

)
Expand description
Equivalent to the appropriate
llvm.memcpy.p0i8.0i8.*
intrinsic, with
a size of
count
*
size_of::<T>()
and an alignment of
min_align_of::<T>()
This intrinsic does not have a stable counterpart.
Â§
Safety
The safety requirements are consistent with
copy_nonoverlapping
while the read and write behaviors are volatile,
which means it will not be optimized out unless
_count
or
size_of::<T>()
is equal to zero.
