Expand description
Deallocates a memory which allocated by
intrinsics::const_allocate
at compile time.
At runtime, does nothing.
Â§
Safety
The
align
argument must be a power of two.
At compile time, a compile error occurs if this constraint is violated.
At runtime, it is not checked.
If the
ptr
is created in an another const, this intrinsic doesnâ€™t deallocate it.
If the
ptr
is pointing to a local variable, this intrinsic doesnâ€™t deallocate it.
