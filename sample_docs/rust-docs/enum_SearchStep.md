)
Expresses that a match of the pattern has been found at
haystack[a..b]
.

Reject(
usize
,
usize
)
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
pattern
#27721
)
Expresses that
haystack[a..b]
has been rejected as a possible match
of the pattern.
Note that there might be more than one
Reject
between two
Match
es,
there is no requirement for them to be combined into one.

Expresses that every byte of the haystack has been visited, ending
the iteration.
