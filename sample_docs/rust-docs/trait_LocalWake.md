Expand description
An analogous trait to
Wake
but used to construct a
LocalWaker
.
This API works in exactly the same way as
Wake
,
except that it uses an
Rc
instead of an
Arc
,
and the result is a
LocalWaker
instead of a
Waker
.
The benefits of using
LocalWaker
over
Waker
are that it allows the local waker
to hold data that does not implement
Send
and
Sync
. Additionally, it saves calls
to
Arc::clone
, which requires atomic synchronization.

Examples
This is a simplified example of a
spawn
and a
block_on
function. The
spawn
function
is used to push new tasks onto the run queue, while the block on function will remove them
and poll them. When a task is woken, it will put itself back on the run queue to be polled
by the executor.
Note:
This example trades correctness for simplicity. A real world example would interleave
poll calls with calls to an io reactor to wait for events instead of spinning on a loop.

Required Methods
Â§
Source
fn
wake
(self:
Rc
<Self>)
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
local_waker
#118959
)
Wake this task.
Provided Methods
Â§
Source
fn
wake_by_ref
(self: &
Rc
<Self>)
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
local_waker
#118959
)
Wake this task without consuming the local waker.
If an executor supports a cheaper way to wake without consuming the
waker, it should override this method. By default, it clones the
Rc
and calls
wake
on the clone.
Dyn Compatibility
Â§
This trait is
not
dyn compatible
.
In older versions of Rust, dyn compatibility was called "object safety", so this trait is not object safe.
