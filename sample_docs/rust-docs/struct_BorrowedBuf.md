Expand description
A borrowed byte buffer which is incrementally filled and initialized.
This type is a sort of โdouble cursorโ. It tracks three regions in the buffer: a region at the beginning of the
buffer that has been logically filled with data, a region that has been initialized at some point but not yet
logically filled, and a region at the end that is fully uninitialized. The filled region is guaranteed to be a
subset of the initialized region.
In summary, the contents of the buffer can be visualized as:
[             capacity              ]
[ filled |         unfilled         ]
[    initialized    | uninitialized ]
A
BorrowedBuf
is created around some existing data (or capacity for data) via a unique reference
(
&mut
). The
BorrowedBuf
can be configured (e.g., using
clear
or
set_init
), but cannot be
directly written. To write into the buffer, use
unfilled
to create a
BorrowedCursor
. The cursor
has write-only access to the unfilled portion of the buffer (you can think of it as a
write-only iterator).
The lifetime
'data
is a bound on the lifetime of the underlying data.

BorrowedBuf
<'data>
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
core_io_borrowed_buf

)
Clears the buffer, resetting the filled region to empty.
The number of initialized bytes is not changed, and the contents of the buffer are not modified.
Source
pub unsafe fn
set_init
(&mut self, n:
usize
) -> &mut
BorrowedBuf
<'data>
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
core_io_borrowed_buf
#117693
)
Asserts that the first
n
bytes of the buffer are initialized.
BorrowedBuf
assumes that bytes are never de-initialized, so this method does nothing when called with fewer
bytes than are already known to be initialized.
ยง
Safety
The caller must ensure that the first
n
unfilled bytes of the buffer have already been initialized.
