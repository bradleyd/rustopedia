unit - Rust
Primitive Type
unit
Copy item path

Expand description
The
()
type, also called โunitโ.
The
()
type has exactly one value
()
, and is used when there
is no other meaningful value that could be returned.
()
is most
commonly seen implicitly: functions without a
-> ...
implicitly
have return type
()
, that is, these are equivalent:
fn
long() -> () {}
fn
short() {}
The semicolon
;
can be used to discard the result of an
expression at the end of a block, making the expression (and thus
the block) evaluate to
()
. For example,
fn
returns_i64() -> i64 {
1i64
}
fn
returns_unit() {
1i64
;
}
let
is_i64 = {
    returns_i64()
};
let
is_unit = {
    returns_i64();
};

impl
FromIterator
<
()
> for
()
Collapses all unit items from an iterator into one.
This is more useful when combined with higher-level abstractions, like
collecting to a
Result<(), E>
where you only care about errors:
use
std::io::
*
;
let
data =
vec!
[
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
];
let
res:
Result
<()> = data.iter()
    .map(|x|
writeln!
(stdout(),
"{x}"
))
    .collect();
assert!
(res.is_ok());
