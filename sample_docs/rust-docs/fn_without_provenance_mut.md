pub const fn without_provenance_mut<T>(addr:
usize
) ->
*mut T
Expand description
Creates a pointer with the given address and no
provenance
.
This is equivalent to
ptr::null_mut().with_addr(addr)
.
Without provenance, this pointer is not associated with any actual allocation. Such a
no-provenance pointer may be used for zero-sized memory accesses (if suitably aligned), but
non-zero-sized memory accesses with a no-provenance pointer are UB. No-provenance pointers are
little more than a
usize
address in disguise.
This is different from
addr as *mut T
, which creates a pointer that picks up a previously
exposed provenance. See
with_exposed_provenance_mut
for more details on that operation.
This is a
Strict Provenance
API.
