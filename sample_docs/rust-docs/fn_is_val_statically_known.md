This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
core_intrinsics
)
Expand description
Returns whether the argumentâ€™s value is statically known at
compile-time.
This is useful when there is a way of writing the code that will
be
faster
when some variables have known values, but
slower
in the general case: an
if is_val_statically_known(var)
can be used
to select between these two variants. The
if
will be optimized away
and only the desired branch remains.
Formally speaking, this function non-deterministically returns
true
or
false
, and the caller has to ensure sound behavior for both cases.
In other words, the following code has
Undefined Behavior
:
#![feature(core_intrinsics)]
use
std::hint::unreachable_unchecked;
use
std::intrinsics::is_val_statically_known;
if
!is_val_statically_known(
0
) {
unsafe
{ unreachable_unchecked(); } }
This also means that the following codeâ€™s behavior is unspecified; it
may panic, or it may not:
#![feature(core_intrinsics)]
use
std::intrinsics::is_val_statically_known;
assert_eq!
(is_val_statically_known(
0
), is_val_statically_known(
0
));
Unsafe code may not rely on
is_val_statically_known
returning any
particular value, ever. However, the compiler will generally make it
return
true
only if the value of the argument is actually known.
Â§
Stability concerns
While it is safe to call, this intrinsic may behave differently in
a
const
context than otherwise. See the
const_eval_select()
documentation for an explanation of the issues this can cause. Unlike
const_eval_select
, this intrinsic isnâ€™t guaranteed to behave
deterministically even in a
const
context.
Â§
Type Requirements
T
must be either a
bool
, a
char
, a primitive numeric type (e.g.
f32
,
but not
NonZeroISize
), or any thin pointer (e.g.
*mut String
).
Any other argument types
may
cause a compiler error.
Â§
Pointers
When the input is a pointer, only the pointer itself is
ever considered. The pointee has no effect. Currently, these functions
behave identically:
#![feature(core_intrinsics)]
use
std::intrinsics::is_val_statically_known;
fn
foo(x:
&
i32) -> bool {
    is_val_statically_known(x)
}
fn
bar(x:
&
i32) -> bool {
    is_val_statically_known(
        (x
as
*const
i32).addr()
    )
}
