Expand description
Uses
park_timeout
.
Blocks unless or until the current threadâ€™s token is made available or
the specified duration has been reached (may wake spuriously).
The semantics of this function are equivalent to
park
except
that the thread will be blocked for roughly no longer than
dur
. This
method should not be used for precise timing due to anomalies such as
preemption or platform differences that might not cause the maximum
amount of time waited to be precisely
ms
long.
See the
park documentation
for more detail.
