Expand description
Uses
sleep
.
Puts the current thread to sleep for at least the specified amount of time.
The thread may sleep longer than the duration specified due to scheduling
specifics or platform-dependent functionality. It will never sleep less.
This function is blocking, and should not be used in
async
functions.
Â§
Platform-specific behavior
On Unix platforms, the underlying syscall may be interrupted by a
spurious wakeup or signal handler. To ensure the sleep occurs for at least
the specified duration, this function may invoke that system call multiple
times.
Â§
Examples
use
std::thread;
// Let's sleep for 2 seconds:
thread::sleep_ms(
2000
);
