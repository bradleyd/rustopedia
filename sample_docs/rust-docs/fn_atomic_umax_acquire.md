Expand description
Maximum with the current value using an unsigned comparison.
T
must be an unsigned integer type.
The stabilized version of this intrinsic is available on the
atomic
unsigned integer types via the
fetch_max
method by passing
Ordering::Acquire
as the
order
. For example,
AtomicU32::fetch_max
.
