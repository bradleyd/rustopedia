pub struct ChildStdin {
/* private fields */
}
Expand description
A handle to a child processโs standard input (stdin).
This struct is used in the
stdin
field on
Child
.
When an instance of
ChildStdin
is
dropped
, the
ChildStdin
โs underlying
file handle will be closed. If the child process was blocked on input prior
to being dropped, it will become unblocked after dropping.
