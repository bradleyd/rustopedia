Expand description
Lexicographically compare
[left, left + bytes)
and
[right, right + bytes)
as unsigned bytes, returning negative if
left
is less, zero if all the
bytes match, or positive if
left
is greater.
This underlies things like
<[u8]>::cmp
, and will usually lower to
memcmp
.

Safety
left
and
right
must each be

bytes.
Note that this applies to the whole range, not just until the first byte
that differs.  That allows optimizations that can read in large chunks.
