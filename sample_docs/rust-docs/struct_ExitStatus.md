pub struct ExitStatus(
/* private fields */
);
Expand description
Describes the result of a process after it has terminated.
This
struct
is used to represent the exit status or other termination of a child process.
Child processes are created via the
Command
struct and their exit
status is exposed through the
status
method, or the
wait
method
of a
Child
process.
An
ExitStatus
represents every possible disposition of a process.  On Unix this
is the
wait status
.  It is
not
simply an
exit status
(a value passed to
exit
).
For proper error reporting of failed processes, print the value of
ExitStatus
or
ExitStatusError
using their implementations of
Display
.
ยง
Differences from
ExitCode
ExitCode
is intended for terminating the currently running process, via
the
Termination
trait, in contrast to
ExitStatus
, which represents the
termination of a child process. These APIs are separate due to platform
compatibility differences and their expected usage; it is not generally
possible to exactly reproduce an
ExitStatus
from a child for the current
process after the fact.

This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
exit_status_error
#84908
)
Was termination successful?  Returns a
Result
.
ยง
Examples
#![feature(exit_status_error)]
use
std::process::Command;
let
status = Command::new(
"ls"
)
    .arg(
"/dev/nonexistent"
)
    .status()
    .expect(
"ls could not be executed"
);
println!
(
"ls: {status}"
);
status.exit_ok().expect_err(
"/dev/nonexistent could be listed!"
);

pub fn
success
(&self) ->
bool
Was termination successful? Signal termination is not considered a
success, and success is defined as a zero exit status.
ยง
Examples
use
std::process::Command;
let
status = Command::new(
"mkdir"
)
    .arg(
"projects"
)
    .status()
    .expect(
"failed to execute mkdir"
);
if
status.success() {
println!
(
"'projects/' directory created"
);
}
else
{
println!
(
"failed to create 'projects/' directory: {status}"
);
}

pub fn
code
(&self) ->
Option
<
i32
>
Returns the exit code of the process, if any.
In Unix terms the return value is the
exit status
: the value passed to
exit
, if the
process finished by calling
exit
.  Note that on Unix the exit status is truncated to 8
bits, and that values that didnโt come from a programโs call to
exit
may be invented by the
runtime system (often, for example, 255, 254, 127 or 126).
On Unix, this will return
None
if the process was terminated by a signal.
ExitStatusExt
is an
extension trait for extracting any such signal, and other details, from the
ExitStatus
.

Examples
use
std::process::Command;
let
status = Command::new(
"mkdir"
)
    .arg(
"projects"
)
    .status()
    .expect(
"failed to execute mkdir"
);
match
status.code() {
Some
(code) =>
println!
(
"Exited with status code: {code}"
),
None
=>
println!
(
"Process terminated by signal"
)
}
