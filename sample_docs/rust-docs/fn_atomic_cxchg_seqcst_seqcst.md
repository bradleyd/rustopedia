Expand description
Stores a value if the current value is the same as the
old
value.
T
must be an integer or pointer type.
The stabilized version of this intrinsic is available on the
atomic
types via the
compare_exchange
method by passing
Ordering::SeqCst
as both the success and failure parameters.
For example,
AtomicBool::compare_exchange
.
