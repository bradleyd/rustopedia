Expand description
A unique identifier for a running thread.
A
ThreadId
is an opaque object that uniquely identifies each thread
created during the lifetime of a process.
ThreadId
s are guaranteed not to
be reused, even when a thread terminates.
ThreadId
s are under the control
of Rustโs standard library and there may not be any relationship between
ThreadId
and the underlying platformโs notion of a thread identifier โ
the two concepts cannot, therefore, be used interchangeably. A
ThreadId
can be retrieved from the
id
method on a
Thread
.

Examples
use
std::thread;
let
other_thread = thread::spawn(|| {
    thread::current().id()
});
let
other_thread_id = other_thread.join().unwrap();
assert!
(thread::current().id() != other_thread_id);

This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
thread_id_value
#67939
)
This returns a numeric identifier for the thread identified by this
ThreadId
.
As noted in the documentation for the type itself, it is essentially an
opaque ID, but is guaranteed to be unique for each thread. The returned
value is entirely opaque โ only equality testing is stable. Note that
it is not guaranteed which values new threads will return, and this may
change across Rust versions.
