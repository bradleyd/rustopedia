Expand description
The global memory allocator.
This type implements the
Allocator
trait by forwarding calls
to the allocator registered with the
#[global_allocator]
attribute
if there is one, or the
std
crateโs default.
Note: while this type is unstable, the functionality it provides can be
accessed through the
free functions in
alloc
.
