Expand description
A priority queue implemented with a binary heap.
This will be a max-heap.
It is a logic error for an item to be modified in such a way that the
itemâ€™s ordering relative to any other item, as determined by the
Ord
trait, changes while it is in the heap. This is normally only possible
through interior mutability, global state, I/O, or unsafe code. The
behavior resulting from such a logic error is not specified, but will
be encapsulated to the
BinaryHeap
that observed the logic error and not
result in undefined behavior. This could include panics, incorrect results,
aborts, memory leaks, and non-termination.
As long as no elements change their relative order while being in the heap
as described above, the API of
BinaryHeap
guarantees that the heap
invariant remains intact i.e. its methods all behave as documented. For
example if a method is documented as iterating in sorted order, thatâ€™s
guaranteed to work as long as elements in the heap have not changed order,
even in the presence of closures getting unwinded out of, iterators getting
leaked, and similar foolishness.
Â§
Examples
use
std::collections::BinaryHeap;
// Type inference lets us omit an explicit type signature (which
// would be `BinaryHeap<i32>` in this example).
let
mut
heap = BinaryHeap::new();
// We can use peek to look at the next item in the heap. In this case,
// there's no items in there yet so we get None.
assert_eq!
(heap.peek(),
None
);
// Let's add some scores...
heap.push(
1
);
heap.push(
5
);
heap.push(
2
);
// Now peek shows the most important item in the heap.
assert_eq!
(heap.peek(),
Some
(
&
5
));
// We can check the length of a heap.
assert_eq!
(heap.len(),
3
);
// We can iterate over the items in the heap, although they are returned in
// a random order.
for
x
in
&
heap {
println!
(
"{x}"
);
}
// If we instead pop these scores, they should come back in order.
assert_eq!
(heap.pop(),
Some
(
5
));
assert_eq!
(heap.pop(),
Some
(
2
));
assert_eq!
(heap.pop(),
Some
(
1
));
assert_eq!
(heap.pop(),
None
);
// We can clear the heap of any remaining items.
heap.clear();
// The heap should now be empty.
assert!
(heap.is_empty())
A
BinaryHeap
with a known list of items can be initialized from an array:
use
std::collections::BinaryHeap;
let
heap = BinaryHeap::from([
1
,
5
,
2
]);
Â§
Min-heap
Either
core::cmp::Reverse
or a custom
Ord
implementation can be used to
make
BinaryHeap
a min-heap. This makes
heap.pop()
return the smallest
value instead of the greatest one.
use
std::collections::BinaryHeap;
use
std::cmp::Reverse;
let
mut
heap = BinaryHeap::new();
// Wrap values in `Reverse`
heap.push(Reverse(
1
));
heap.push(Reverse(
5
));
heap.push(Reverse(
2
));
// If we pop these scores now, they should come back in the reverse order.
assert_eq!
(heap.pop(),
Some
(Reverse(
1
)));
assert_eq!
(heap.pop(),
Some
(Reverse(
2
)));
assert_eq!
(heap.pop(),
Some
(Reverse(
5
)));
assert_eq!

None

Â§
Time complexity
The expected cost of
push
, averaged over every possible ordering of
the elements being pushed, and over a sufficiently large number of
pushes, is
O
(1). This is the most meaningful cost metric when pushing
elements that are
not
already in any sorted pattern.
The time complexity degrades if elements are pushed in predominantly
ascending order. In the worst case, elements are pushed in ascending
sorted order and the amortized cost per push is
O
(log(
n
)) against a heap
containing
n
elements.
The worst case cost of a
single
call to
push
is
O
(
n
). The worst case
occurs when capacity is exhausted and needs a resize. The resize cost
has been amortized in the previous figures.

(&mut self) ->
DrainSorted
<'_, T, A>
â“˜
ðŸ”¬
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
binary_heap_drain_sorted
#59278
)
Clears the binary heap, returning an iterator over the removed elements
in heap order. If the iterator is dropped before being fully consumed,
it drops the remaining elements in heap order.
The returned iterator keeps a mutable borrow on the heap to optimize
its implementation.
Note:
.drain_sorted()
is

.drain()
.
You should use the latter for most cases.
