pub fn
clone
(orig: &
Ref
<'b, T>) ->
Ref
<'b, T>
Copies a
Ref
.
The
RefCell
is already immutably borrowed, so this cannot fail.
This is an associated function that needs to be used as
Ref::clone(...)
. A
Clone
implementation or a method would interfere
with the widespread use of
r.borrow().clone()
to clone the contents of
a
RefCell
.

Makes a new
Ref
for a component of the borrowed data.
The
RefCell
is already immutably borrowed, so this cannot fail.
This is an associated function that needs to be used as
Ref::map(...)
.
A method would interfere with methods of the same name on the contents
of a
RefCell
used through
Deref
.

pub fn
leak
(orig:

&'b T
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
cell_leak
#69099
)
Converts into a reference to the underlying data.
The underlying
RefCell
can never be mutably borrowed from again and will always appear
already immutably borrowed. It is not a good idea to leak more than a constant number of
references. The
RefCell
can be immutably borrowed again if only a smaller number of leaks
have occurred in total.
This is an associated function that needs to be used as
Ref::leak(...)

same name on the contents of a
