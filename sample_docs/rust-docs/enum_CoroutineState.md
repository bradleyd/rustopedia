Enum
CoroutineState
Copy item path
Source
pub enum CoroutineState<Y, R> {
    Yielded(Y),
    Complete(R),
}
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
coroutine_trait
#43122
)
Expand description
The result of a coroutine resumption.
This enum is returned from the
Coroutine::resume
method and indicates the
possible return values of a coroutine. Currently this corresponds to either
a suspension point (
Yielded
) or a termination point (
Complete
).
Variants
ยง
ยง
Yielded(Y)
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
coroutine_trait
#43122
)
The coroutine suspended with a value.
This state indicates that a coroutine has been suspended, and typically
corresponds to a
yield
statement. The value provided in this variant
corresponds to the expression passed to
yield
and allows coroutines to
provide a value each time they yield.
ยง
Complete(R)
๐ฌ
This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
coroutine_trait
#43122
)
The coroutine completed with a return value.
This state indicates that a coroutine has finished execution with the
provided value. Once a coroutine has returned
Complete
it is
considered a programmer error to call
resume
again.
