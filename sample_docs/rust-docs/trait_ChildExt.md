fn

This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
linux_pidfd
#82971
)
Obtains a reference to the
PidFd
created for this
Child
, if available.
A pidfd will only be available if its creation was requested with
create_pidfd
when the corresponding
Command
was created.
Even if requested, a pidfd may not be available due to an older
version of Linux being in use, or if some other error occurred.

This is a nightly-only experimental API. (
linux_pidfd
#82971
)
Returns the
PidFd
created for this
Child
, if available.
Otherwise self is returned.
A pidfd will only be available if its creation was requested with
create_pidfd
when the corresponding
Command
was created.
Taking ownership of the PidFd consumes the Child to avoid pid reuse
races. Use
pidfd
and
BorrowedFd::try_clone_to_owned
if
you donâ€™t want to disassemble the Child yet.
Even if requested, a pidfd may not be available due to an older
version of Linux being in use, or if some other error occurred.
