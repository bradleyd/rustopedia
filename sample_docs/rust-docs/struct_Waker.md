Expand description
A
Waker
is a handle for waking up a task by notifying its executor that it
is ready to be run.
This handle encapsulates a
RawWaker
instance, which defines the
executor-specific wakeup behavior.
The typical life of a
Waker
is that it is constructed by an executor, wrapped in a
Context
, then passed to
Future::poll()
. Then, if the future chooses to return
Poll::Pending
, it must also store the waker somehow and call
Waker::wake()
when
the future should be polled again.
Implements
Clone
,
Send
, and
Sync
; therefore, a waker may be invoked
from any thread, including ones not in any way managed by the executor. For example,
this might be done to wake a future when a blocking function call completes on another
thread.
Note that it is preferable to use
waker.clone_from(&new_waker)
instead
of
*waker = new_waker.clone()
, as the former will avoid cloning the waker
unnecessarily if the two wakers
wake the same task
.
Constructing a
Waker
from a
RawWaker
is unsafe.
Implementing the
Wake
trait is a safe alternative that requires memory allocation.

impl
Waker
1.36.0
Â·
Source
pub fn
wake
(self)
Wakes up the task associated with this
Waker
.
As long as the executor keeps running and the task is not finished, it is
guaranteed that each invocation of
wake()
(or
wake_by_ref()
) will be followed by at least one
poll()
of the task to which this
Waker
belongs. This makes
it possible to temporarily yield to other tasks while running potentially
unbounded processing loops.
Note that the above implies that multiple wake-ups may be coalesced into a
single
poll()
invocation by the runtime.
Also note that yielding to competing tasks is not guaranteed: it is the
executorâ€™s choice which task to run and the executor may choose to run the
current task again.
1.36.0
Â·
Source
pub fn
wake_by_ref
(&self)
Wakes up the task associated with this
Waker
without consuming the
Waker
.
This is similar to
wake()
, but may be slightly less efficient in
the case where an owned
Waker
is available. This method should be preferred to
calling
waker.clone().wake()
.
1.36.0
Â·
Source
pub fn
will_wake
(&self, other: &
Waker
) ->
bool
Returns
true
if this
Waker
and another
Waker
would awake the same task.
This function works on a best-effort basis, and may return false even
when the
Waker
s would awaken the same task. However, if this function
returns
true
, it is guaranteed that the
Waker
s will awaken the same task.
This function is primarily used for optimization purposes â€” for example,
this typeâ€™s
clone_from
implementation uses it to
avoid cloning the waker when they would wake the same task anyway.

Source
pub const unsafe fn
new
(
    data:
*const
()
,
    vtable: &'static
RawWakerVTable
,
) ->
Waker
Creates a new
Waker
from the provided
data
pointer and
vtable
.
The
data
pointer can be used to store arbitrary data as required
by the executor. This could be e.g. a type-erased pointer to an
Arc
that is associated with the task.
The value of this pointer will get passed to all functions that are part
of the
vtable
as the first parameter.
It is important to consider that the
data
pointer must point to a
thread safe type such as an
Arc
.
The
vtable
customizes the behavior of a
Waker
. For each operation
on the
Waker
, the associated function in the
vtable
will be called.
Â§
Safety
The behavior of the returned
Waker
is undefined if the contract defined
in
RawWakerVTable
â€™s documentation is not upheld.
(Authors wishing to avoid unsafe code may implement the
Wake
trait instead, at the
cost of a required heap allocation.)

1.85.0 (const: 1.85.0)
Â·
Source
pub const fn
noop
() -> &'static
Waker
Returns a reference to a
Waker
that does nothing when used.
This is mostly useful for writing tests that need a
Context
to poll
some futures, but are not expecting those futures to wake the waker or
do not need to do anything specific if it happens.
More generally, using
Waker::noop()
to poll a future
means discarding the notification of when the future should be polled again.
So it should only be used when such a notification will not be needed to make progress.
If an owned
Waker
is needed,
clone()
this one.
Â§
Examples
use
std::future::Future;
use
std::task;
let
mut
cx = task::Context::from_waker(task::Waker::noop());
let
mut
future = Box::pin(
async
{
10
});
assert_eq!
(future.as_mut().poll(
&mut
cx), task::Poll::Ready(
10
));

Clone
for
Waker
Source
Â§
fn
clone_from
(&mut self, source: &
Waker
)
Assigns a clone of
source
to
self
, unless
self.will_wake(source)
anyway.
This method is preferred over simply assigning
source.clone()
to
self
,
as it avoids cloning the waker if
self
is already the same waker.
